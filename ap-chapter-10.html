<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is wave summation in muscle fiber twitches?</p>
<p class="answer">repeated stimulation of a muscle fiber by a motor neuron results in twitches with progressively greater tension.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What determines the number of cross-bridges that can form in a sarcomere?</p>

<p class="subTopicHeader">Tension Production and the Timing and Frequency of Stimulation</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is wave summation?</p>
<p class="answer">an increase in tension caused by repeated stimulation of a muscle fiber, where calcium ions accumulate in the cytosol and the muscle has little time to relax.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Why does wave summation occur?</p>
<p class="answer">because the SR does not have to pump all calcium ions back into the SR, allowing cytosolic calcium to increase with each stimulation.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is fused (complete) tetanus?</p>
<p class="answer">a condition where the muscle fiber does not relax between stimuli and tension stays constant at nearly 100% of maximum.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">How does increased calcium availability affect tension during fused tetanus?</p>
<p class="answer">it allows more cross-bridges to form, contributing to increased tension.</p>
<p class="subTopicHeader">Length-Tension Relationship</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is the length-tension relationship?</p>
<p class="answer">the concept that a sarcomere at about 100–120% of its natural length can generate the greatest tension.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Why does optimal sarcomere length produce maximum tension?</p>
<p class="answer">because it allows enough overlap between thin and thick filaments for many cross-bridges to form while leaving space for thick filaments to pull thin filaments toward the M line without hitting Z-discs.</p>

<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are Type II skeletal muscle fibers like?</p>
<p class="answer">large-diameter, fast-twitch fibers that fatigue quickly, have high myosin ATPase activity, rely mainly on glycolytic catabolism, have fewer mitochondria, lower myoglobin, less extensive blood supply, and are classified as “white muscle.”</p>

<p class="subTopicHeader">Classes of Skeletal Muscle Fibers</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Class I (Slow Oxidative)</p>
<p class="answer">Slow Oxidative fibers (Type I) primarily use oxidative catabolism.</p>
<p class="answer">They have an extensive blood supply, many mitochondria, and a large amount of myoglobin, giving them a red color. They contain little glycogen and have low myosin ATPase activity, making them highly fatigue-resistant (low fatigability). These are small to intermediate in diameter and are used for activities requiring sustained effort, such as standing and sitting.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Class IIa (Fast Oxidative Glycolytic)</p>
<p class="answer">Fast Oxidative Glycolytic fibers (Type IIa) utilize oxidative and glycolytic catabolism.</p>
<p class="answer">They have a less extensive blood supply than Type I, an intermediate number of mitochondria, and an intermediate amount of myoglobin, resulting in a light red color. They also have intermediate amounts of glycogen and exhibit high myosin ATPase activity. Their fatigability is intermediate. These are large in diameter and are used in activities like walking and writing.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Class IIx (Fast Glycolytic)</p>
<p class="answer">Fast Glycolytic fibers (Type IIx) rely almost entirely on glycolytic catabolism.</p>
<p class="answer">They have a limited blood supply, few mitochondria, and little myoglobin, giving them a color of light pink to white. These fibers store a large amount of glycogen and possess the highest myosin ATPase activity. They are easily fatigued (high fatigability) and are intermediate in diameter. They are recruited for powerful, short-duration activities such as heavy lifting and sprinting.</p>
<p class="subTopicHeader">Botulism and Botox</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What produces botulinum toxin and how potent is it?</p>

<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What happens when someone is exposed to botulinum toxin?</p>

<hr class="divider"><p class="question">How do muscle fibers within a motor unit respond?</p>
<p class="answer">all fibers respond with the same amount of tension.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">How does the number of fibers in a motor unit relate to movement?</p>
<p class="answer">smaller motor units allow fine movement, while larger motor units generate greater force.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is recruitment in muscle contraction?</p>
<p class="answer">the process of stimulating more motor units as greater force is required.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What produces muscle tone and why is it important?</p>
<p class="answer">a small amount of tension produces muscle tone, which helps maintain posture, stabilize joints, generate heat, and keep muscles prepared for movement.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">How does the nervous system manage motor units during sustained activity?</p>
<p class="answer">it alternates activation so some motor units can rest while others contract.</p>
<p class="subTopicHeader">Types of Muscle Contractions</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What factors influence the amount of tension a muscle generates?</p>
<p class="answer">the number of motor units activated and how the length of the muscle changes during contraction.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Is muscle contraction only about shortening the muscle?</p>
<p class="answer">no, contractions also occur during muscle fiber lengthening.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are the three types of muscle contractions based on muscle length?</p>
<p class="answer">isotonic concentric, isotonic eccentric, and isometric.</p>
<p class="subTopicHeader">Types of Muscle Contractions</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are isotonic contractions?</p>
<p class="answer">contractions where tension is constant but muscle length changes.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What happens during isotonic concentric contractions?</p>
<p class="answer">muscle shortens while generating constant tension; force generated is greater than the external force.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What happens during isotonic eccentric contractions?</p>
<p class="answer">muscle lengthens while generating constant tension; external force is greater than the force generated by the muscle, and elastic filaments allow stretching.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are isometric contractions?</p>
<p class="answer">contractions where muscle length remains unchanged because the external force equals the force generated by the muscle.</p>
<p class="subTopicHeader">Delayed-Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS)</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS)?</p>
<p class="answer">muscle soreness following exercise, traditionally thought to result from lactic acid accumulation during glycolysis.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is the current understanding of the cause of DOMS?</p>
<p class="answer">minor structural damage to muscles, especially from isotonic eccentric contractions, and myofibril remodeling as an adaptive response to stress.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is the most effective treatment for DOMS?</p>
<p class="answer">continued exercise to condition the muscle; stopping exercise can cause pain to return until muscles adapt.</p>
