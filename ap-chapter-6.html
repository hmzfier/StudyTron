<p class="answer">In this context, “takes” means that the donor bone marrow successfully starts producing new, healthy blood cells in the recipient.</p>
<p class="answer">If the transplant “takes,” the donor stem cells engraft in the recipient’s marrow, multiply, and restore proper blood cell production.</p>
<p class="answer">If it doesn’t take, the donor cells fail to grow or are rejected, and the transplant is unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="answer">So basically, “takes” = the transplant works as intended.</p>
