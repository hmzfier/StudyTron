<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the role of calcium in a muscle contraction and where it comes from</p>
<p class="answer">Without calcium, no contraction can happen — actin and myosin can’t interact.</p>
<p class="answer">Source of calcium → Released from sarcoplasmic reticulum into the muscle cytosol.</p>
<p class="answer">Role in contraction → Binds troponin, moves tropomyosin off actin binding sites → allows myosin to bind actin → enables cross-bridge cycling and muscle contraction.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the cross-bridge cycle components: how ATP is involved, what the power stroke is</p>
<p class="answer">Cross-bridge cycle components in order:</p>
<p class="answer">1. ATP binds myosin → detaches myosin from actin.</p>
<p class="answer">2. ATP hydrolysis (ATP → ADP + P) → “cocks” myosin head into high-energy position.</p>
<p class="answer">3. Myosin binds actin → forms cross-bridge.</p>
<p class="answer">4. Power stroke → phosphate release causes myosin head to pivot, pulling actin toward sarcomere center.</p>
<p class="answer">5. ADP released → myosin remains bound until new ATP attaches → cycle repeats.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">skeletal muscle relaxation components - 5 steps</p>
<p class="answer">1. Motor neuron stops firing action potentials.  No more acetylcholine (ACh) is released</p>
<p class="answer">2. Acetylcholinesterase degrades the remaining acetylcholine, and the final repolarization occurs</p>
<p class="answer">3. The sarcolemma returns to its resting membrane potential, and the calcium ion channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum close.</p>
<p class="answer">4. Calcium ions are actively pumped back into Sarcoplasmic reticulum (using ATP)</p>
<p class="answer">5. Troponin shifts and pulls tropomyosin back into position to block the active sites of actin, and the muscle relaxes</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">where ATP is required in the skeletal muscle - 4</p>
<p class="answer">1. Power Sodium/Potassium pumps that maintain ion gradients (action potentials)</p>
<p class="answer">2. Release myosin heads from actin active sites</p>
<p class="answer">3. recock heads for another power stroke</p>
<p class="answer">4. Pump calcium back into SR (relaxation</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">how ATP is generated in the skeletal muscle and A. the immediate sources and b. glycolysis and c. oxidative catabolism</p>
<p class="highlight">1. Immediate cytosolic reactions</p>
<p class="answer">In the cytosol</p>
<p class="answer">Creatine phosphate donates phosphate to ADP → ATP</p>
<p class="answer">ATP yield: Small (enough for ~10 seconds)</p>
<p class="highlight">2. Glycolysis catabolism</p>
<p class="answer">in cytosol</p>
<p class="answer">results in production of 2 ATP</p>
<p class="answer">anaerobic - no oxygen required</p>
<p class="answer">Glucose → pyruvate → 2 ATP (anaerobic, short-term, lactic acid may form).</p>
<p class="answer">ATP Duration: 30 sec–2 min</p>
<p class="highlight">3. Oxidative catabolism</p>
<p class="answer">in mitochondria</p>
<p class="answer">results in production of many ATP</p>
<p class="answer">aerobic = requires oxygen</p>
<p class="answer">Allows for longer lasting muscle contractions</p>
<p class="answer">ATP Duration: Minutes–hours</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">how skeletal muscle is affected by physical training</p>
<p class="answer">Endurance Training = muscles work longer, not bigger.</p>
<p class="answer">Resistance training (strength) = Fewer reps, heavy weight → muscles grow larger and stronger (hypertrophy)</p>
<p class="answer">Disuse = No activity → muscles shrink and weaken (Atrophy)</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">what leads to muscle fatigue</p>
<p class="answer">Fatigue - inability to maintain a given level of intensity during activity; caused by multiple factors:</p>
<p class="answer">Depletion of key metabolites (creatine phosphate, glycogen, and glucose) involved in ATP production</p>
<p class="answer">Decreased availability of oxygen to muscle fibers (increased demand during exercise, depleted myoglobin-bound oxygen and inadequate oxygen intake in lungs)</p>
<p class="answer">Accumulation of certain chemicals in fiber (Ca++ , ADP, and phosphate)</p>
<p class="answer">Environmental conditions, particularly extreme heat; sweating may also cause electrolyte disturbances</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the functions of nervous system</p>
<p class="highlight">The Nervous system controls perception and experience of world:</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Directs voluntary movement</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Seat of consciousness, personality, learning, and memory</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Regulates many aspects of homeostasis with endocrine system: respiratory rate, blood pressure, body temperature, sleep/wake cycle, blood pH</p>
<p class="highlight">Chatgpt answer:</p>
<p class="answer">sensory input</p>
<p class="answer">Integration =  - analyze and interpret incoming sensory information; determine an appropriate response</p>
<p class="answer">motor output</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the structures in the CNS vs. PNS</p>
<p class="answer">CNS = brain & spinal cord</p>
<p class="answer">PNS = cranial nerves, spinal nerves, ganglia.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the functional divisions of the Nervous system</p>
<p class="answer">sensory (afferent) - from both subdivisions carried from receptors to spinal cord and/or brain by spinal and cranial nerves</p>
<p class="answer">Integrative - analyze and interpret incoming sensory information; determine an appropriate response</p>
<p class="answer">motor (efferent → somatic & autonomic; autonomic → sympathetic & parasympathetic).</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the structures of the neuron</p>
<p class="answer">Cell body (soma) – most metabolically active region; manufactures all proteins needed for whole neuron; organelles support high level of biosynthetic activity:</p>
<p class="answer">Dendrites – short, branched processes; receive input from other neurons, which they transmit toward cell body as electrical impulses; each neuron may have multiple dendrites</p>
<p class="answer">Axon hillock – where axon originates from cell body</p>
<p class="answer">Axon collaterals – branches extending from main axon</p>
<p class="answer">Telodendria – small branches arising from axon and axon collaterals near where extensions end</p>
<p class="answer">Axon terminals or synaptic bulbs – arise from telodendria; components that communicate with target cell</p>
<p class="answer">Axolemma – plasma membrane surrounding axon and its cytoplasm (axoplasm)</p>
