<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the classification of neurons by structural features</p>
<p class="highlight">Multipolar Neuron</p>
<p class="answer">Motor (efferent) neurons, interneurons</p>
<p class="answer">99% of all neurons</p>
<p class="answer">One axon with 2 or more dendrites</p>
<p class="answer">Most neurons in the CNS, motor neurons in the PNS</p>
<p class="highlight">Bipolar Neuron</p>
<p class="answer">Sensory (afferent) neurons</p>
<p class="answer">One axon and one dendrite</p>
<p class="answer">Special sense organs in the PNS, such as the retina and olfactory epithelium</p>
<p class="highlight">Pseudounipolar Neuron</p>
<p class="answer">Sensory (afferent) neurons</p>
<p class="answer">Two axons with no dendrites</p>
<p class="answer">Sensory neurons in the PNS associated with touch, pain, and vibration</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the classification of neurons by functional groups</p>
<p class="highlight">Sensory (afferent) neurons – carry information toward CNS;</p>
<p class="answer">▪Neuron cell bodies in PNS receive information from sensory receptors and - Relay information via axons to brain or spinal cord;</p>
<p class="answer">▪Usually pseudounipolar or bipolar</p>
<p class="highlight">Interneurons (association) neurons – relay information within CNS</p>
<p class="answer">▪Between sensory and motor neurons;</p>
<p class="answer">▪Most neurons in body;</p>
<p class="answer">▪Multipolar;</p>
<p class="answer">▪Communicate with many other neurons</p>
<p class="answer">Motor (efferent) neurons – carry information away from cell body in CNS to muscles and glands;</p>
<p class="answer">▪Mostly multipolar</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the 4 types of neuroglial cells in CNS and their functions</p>
<p class="highlight">Astrocytes — regulate extracellular environment, form blood-brain barrier, structural support.</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Anchor neurons and blood vessels in place; help define and maintain three-dimensional structure of brain</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Transport of nutrients and gases between blood vessels and neurons; regulate extracellular environment of brain</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Formation of blood-brain barrier; protective structure; surrounds capillary endothelial cells; makes them impenetrable to most polar compounds and proteins</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Repair damaged brain tissue by rapid cell division</p>
<p class="answer">Oligodendrocytes — form myelin in CNS.</p>
<p class="answer">Microglia — immune defense, phagocytosis.</p>
<p class="answer">Ependymal cells — produce and circulate CSF.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the 2 types of neuroglial cells in PNS and their functions</p>
<p class="answer">Schwann cells — myelinate certain axons in the pns</p>
<p class="answer">Satellite cells — surround and support cell bodies</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Compare and contrast myelination in the PNS vs. CNS</p>
<p class="highlight">Neurolemma – on outer surface of myelinated axons in PNS: Schwann cell nucleus, organelles, and cytoplasm</p>
<p class="answer">• not present in CNS</p>
<p class="highlight">Number of axons myelinated –</p>
<p class="answer">• Oligodendrocytes have multiple processes that myelinate multiple axons in CNS;</p>
<p class="answer">• Schwann cell only myelinates one axon in PNS</p>
<p class="highlight">Timing of myelination</p>
<p class="answer">Myelination begins early in fetal development in PNS and much later in CNS; very little myelin in brain of newborn</p>
<p class="highlight">CHATGPT:</p>
<p class="answer">PNS: Schwann cells myelinate one segment of one axon each; assist with regeneration.</p>
<p class="answer">CNS: Oligodendrocytes myelinate multiple segments on multiple axons; little to no regeneration.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the different ion channels of the neuron plasma membrane</p>
<p class="answer">Leak channels: always open; allow continuous ion flow to maintain resting membrane potential.</p>
<p class="answer">Ligand-gated channels: open when a chemical (neurotransmitter) binds; create local potentials.</p>
<p class="answer">Voltage-gated channels: open/close in response to membrane voltage changes; generate action potentials.</p>
<p class="answer">Mechanically-gated channels: open when the membrane is physically deformed (pressure, stretch).</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">what local potentials are and how they are different from action potentials</p>
<p class="highlight">Local potentials</p>
<p class="answer">travel short distances</p>
<p class="answer">Size varies - Local potentials vary in size of membrane potential depending on the stimulus</p>
<p class="answer">Reversible</p>
<p class="highlight">Action potentials</p>
<p class="answer">travel entire length of axon</p>
<p class="answer">Same size - action potentials always depolarize to about +30 mV and their size doesn’t change with stimulus strength, frequency, or duration.</p>
<p class="answer">Irreversible</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the 3 general phases of the Action potential and which channels are open or closed</p>
<p class="highlight">Depolarization: voltage-gated sodium channels open, potassium channels closed.</p>
<p class="answer">membrane potential rises toward zero; then becomes positive briefly Repol</p>
<p class="answer">Makes the membrane becomes more positive</p>
<p class="highlight">Repolarization: sodium channels inactivate, potassium channels open.</p>
<p class="answer">Makes the membrane return toward negative.</p>
<p class="highlight">Hyperpolarization: potassium channels still open briefly, sodium channels reset to closed.</p>
<p class="answer">Makes the membrane MORE negative than resting membrane potential.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Compare and contrast the 2 refractory phases</p>
<p class="answer">Absolute refractory period: no new action potential can occur at all because sodium channels are open or inactivated.</p>
<p class="answer">Relative refractory period :after absolute refractory period; only strong stimulus can produce action potential</p>
<p class="answer">▪ takes much larger stimulus to trigger action potential</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">how action potential propagate down the axon and what affects the speed of the action potential</p>
<p class="highlight">Steps</p>
<p class="answer">1. The axolemma depolarizes to threshold due to local potentials</p>
<p class="answer">2. As sodium channels activate, an action potential is triggered and spreads down the axon</p>
<p class="answer">3. the next section of the axolemma depolarizes to threshold and fires an action potential as the previous section of the axolemma repolarizes</p>
<p class="answer">4. the current continues to move down the axon, and the process repeats</p>
<p class="highlight">Above steps simplified by chatgpt</p>
<p class="answer">1. Local potentials bring the first section to threshold.</p>
<p class="answer">2. Na⁺ channels open → the action potential starts and moves forward.</p>
<p class="answer">3. Each new section hits threshold and fires while the previous section repolarizes.</p>
<p class="answer">4. This repeating cycle pushes the action potential down the axon.</p>
<p class="highlight">Steps according to chatgpt</p>
<p class="answer">1. Na⁺ channels open at the trigger zone → an action potential starts.</p>
<p class="answer">2. That depolarization spreads to the next section of the axon.</p>
<p class="answer">3. The next section reaches threshold → Na⁺ channels open there.</p>
<p class="answer">4. The AP regenerates segment by segment down the axon.</p>
<p class="answer">5. Previously active segments enter refractory period, so the AP moves only forward.</p>
<p class="highlight">What increases speed:</p>
<p class="answer">Myelination (fastest; forces AP to jump node-to-node)</p>
<p class="answer">Larger axon diameter (less resistance)</p>
<p class="answer">Higher temperature (up to physiological limits)</p>
