<p class="title">AP Final Core 19</p>

<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the basal nuclei location and function. Also how it prevents spontaneous, inappropriate muscle contractions</p>
<p class="highlight">Location:</p>
<p class="answer">Deep inside the cerebrum, buried within the cerebral hemispheres.</p>
<p class="answer">They surround and flank the thalamus and include structures such as the caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus.</p>
<p class="highlight">Function:</p>
<p class="answer">• Regulate movement</p>
<p class="answer">• Start and stop voluntary movements smoothly</p>
<p class="answer">• Help with motor planning and coordination</p>
<p class="answer">• Suppress unwanted or inappropriate movements</p>
<p class="answer">• Influence posture and muscle tone</p>
<p class="answer">• Contribute to habit formation and certain cognitive functions</p>
<p class="highlight">How they prevent spontaneous, inappropriate muscle contractions:</p>
<p class="answer">The basal nuclei inhibit motor neurons at rest.</p>
<p class="answer">They do this by sending constant inhibitory signals (mainly GABA) to motor pathways.</p>
<p class="answer">This steady inhibition stops random or unintended muscle activity.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the location and function of the limbic system</p>
<p class="answer">Location: A group of 4  structures (fornix, limbic lobe (region of medial cerebrum), hippocampus, amygdala, and pathways) deep in the cerebrum around the diencephalon.</p>
<p class="answer">Function: Involved in memory, learning, emotion, and behavior</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the diencephalon, know its location, the function of the thalamus and hypothalamus and pineal gland</p>
<p class="answer">And subthalamus and the location and function of the cerebellum</p>
<p class="answer">Location of diencephalon: Deep in the brain, between the cerebrum and brainstem.</p>
<p class="answer">Thalamus: Main relay station for sensory information going to the cortex.</p>
<p class="answer">Hypothalamus:  perform several vital functions critical to survival (regulation of autonomic</p>
<p class="answer">nervous system, sleep/wake cycle, thirst and hunger, and body temperature)</p>
<p class="answer">Pineal gland: Produces melatonin and regulates sleep–wake cycles.</p>
<p class="answer">Subthalamus - functionally connected with basal nuclei; together control movement</p>
<p class="highlight">Cerebellum</p>
<p class="answer">Location - Posterior part of the brain, below the occipital lobes, behind the brainstem.</p>
<p class="answer">Function - Coordinates voluntary movements, maintains balance and posture, and fine-tunes motor activities.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the 3 divisions of the brainstem and their location and functions</p>
<p class="answer">Midbrain – top of the brainstem; Functions in movement, sensation, and reflexes</p>
<p class="answer">Pons – middle section; regulation of movement, breathing, reflexes, and complex functions associated with sleep and arousal</p>
<p class="answer">Medulla oblongata – lowest section; controls vital functions like heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the location and function of the reticular formation</p>
<p class="answer">Location: A network of over 100 neurons running through the brainstem (midbrain, pons, medulla).</p>
<p class="highlight">Function:</p>
<p class="answer">▪Function in sleep, pain transmission, and mood</p>
<p class="answer">▪Serve motor functions for both skeletal muscles and autonomic nervous system</p>
<p class="answer">▪Involved in homeostasis of breathing and blood pressure</p>
<p class="answer">▪Play role in sensation and alertness and activity levels of cerebral cortex</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the area of brains that associated with language and what would happen if these areas stopped functioning</p>
<p class="answer">Broca’s area – produces speech.</p>
<p class="answer">If damaged: you know what you want to say but can’t form words (non-fluent speech).</p>
<p class="answer">Wernicke’s area – understands language.</p>
<p class="answer">If damaged: you can speak fluently but the words don’t make sense and you can’t understand language.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the 3 meningeal layers and 3 spaces that help protect the brain</p>
<p class="highlight">Meningeal layers: dura mater, arachnoid mater, pia mater.</p>
<p class="answer">dura mater- thickest and most durable meningeal layer. double-layered membrane (periosteal and meningeal dura)</p>
<p class="answer">arachnoid mater- thin weblike membrane</p>
<p class="answer">pia mater-– deepest meningeal layer. Has physical contact with brain tissue. Permeable to substances in brain extracellular fluid and CSF. Allows for substances to move between fluid compartments</p>
<p class="highlight">Spaces: epidural, subdural, subarachnoid.</p>
<p class="answer">epidural space-”Potentially” between skull and dura mater. Only allows passage of blood vessels</p>
<p class="answer">subdural space- serous fluid-filled space. houses veins that drain blood from brain</p>
<p class="answer">subarachnoid space –contains major blood vessels of brain. filled with CSF</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the location of the 4 ventricles</p>
<p class="answer">• Lateral ventricles – one in each cerebral hemisphere.</p>
<p class="answer">• Third ventricle – in the diencephalon.</p>
<p class="answer">• Fourth ventricle – between pons/medulla and cerebellum.</p>
<p class="answer">Connections:</p>
<p class="answer">Lateral ventricles → interventricular foramen → third ventricle → cerebral aqueduct → fourth ventricle → subarachnoid space.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">how Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is produced</p>
<p class="answer">Produced mostly in choroid plexuses (and in ependymal cells), where blood plasma is filtered and modified into CSF.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the blood brain barrier: how it’s formed, what it allows to pass through and what it prevents from penetrating the brain</p>
<p class="answer">Composed of simple squamous epithelial cells (endothelial cells) of blood capillaries, their basal laminae, and astrocytes</p>
<p class="answer">Endothelial cells form tight junctions to prevent fluids and molecules from passing between them</p>
<p class="answer">Substances that can pass through blood-brain barrier are: water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nonpolar, lipid-based molecules</p>
<p class="answer">Protein channels or carriers allow for passage of other essential molecules across blood-brain barrier are: glucose, amino acids, and ions</p>
<p class="answer">Most large, polar molecules CAN’T cross blood-brain barrier</p>
<p class="answer">Barrier is protective, but can hinder access of medications into brain</p>
