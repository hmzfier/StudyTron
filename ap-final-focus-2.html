<hr class="divider"><p class="question">nonpolar and polar covalent bonds</p>
<p class="highlight">Nonpolar Covalent Bonds</p>
<p class="answer">Two nonmetals in molecule with similar or identical electronegativities pull with equal force; share electrons equally</p>
<p class="answer">Nonpolar molecules occur in 3 situations:</p>
<p class="answer">• Atoms sharing electrons are same element</p>
<p class="answer">• Arrangement of atoms makes one atom unable to pull more strongly than another atom (CO2)</p>
<p class="answer">• Bond is between carbon and hydrogen</p>
<p class="highlight">Polar Covalent Bonds</p>
<p class="answer">Polar covalent bonds – nonmetals with different electronegativities share electrons unequally; form polar molecules</p>
<p class="answer">• Atom with higher electronegativity becomes partially negative pulls shared electrons close to itself</p>
<p class="answer">• Atom with lower electronegativity becomes partially positive shared electrons are pulled toward other atom</p>
<p class="answer">• Dipoles – polar molecules with partially positive and partially negative ends</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Hydrogen Bonds</p>
<p class="answer">weak attractions between partially positive end of one dipole and partially negative end of another dipole</p>
<p class="answer">• Responsible for key property of water – surface tension</p>
<p class="answer">Polar water molecules are more strongly attracted to one another than to nonpolar air molecules at surface</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Endergonic and Exergonic Reactions</p>
<p class="highlight">Endergonic reactions</p>
<p class="answer">• require input of energy from another source;</p>
<p class="answer">• products contain more energy than reactants (energy invested so reaction could proceed)</p>
<p class="highlight">Exergonic reactions</p>
<p class="answer">• release excess energy;</p>
<p class="answer">• products have less energy than reactants</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the difference between Acid and bases</p>
<p class="highlight">Acids:</p>
<p class="answer">An acid dissociates in water to form hydrogen cation (H+) and an anion</p>
<p class="answer">Acids increase the concentration of H+ in the solution</p>
<p class="answer">Strong acids dissociate more (and produce more H+) than weaker acids</p>
<p class="answer">pH < 7</p>
<p class="answer">Taste sour (conceptually)</p>
<p class="answer">Example: HCl</p>
<p class="highlight">Bases:</p>
<p class="answer">A base (alkali) accepts H+ when added to a solution</p>
<p class="answer">Bases decrease the concentration of H+</p>
<p class="answer">• Stronger bases dissociate more and bind more H+ than weaker bases</p>
<p class="answer">• Bicarbonate (HCO3-) is one of the most important weak bases in the body</p>
<p class="answer">pH > 7</p>
<p class="answer">Taste bitter / feel slippery (conceptually)</p>
<p class="answer">Example: NaOH</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">pH scale</p>
<p class="answer">pH = 7; solution is neutral; number of hydrogen ions and base ions are equal</p>
<p class="answer">• pH less than 7 is acidic; hydrogen ions outnumber base ions</p>
<p class="answer">• pH greater than 7 is basic or alkaline; base ions outnumber hydrogen ions</p>
<p class="highlight">Previous test 1 question : Which pH represents a solution that has the highest concentration of hydroxide ions pH1 or pH14</p>
<p class="answer">Answer is pH14</p>
<p class="answer">Hydroxide ions = Basic</p>
<p class="answer">On the pH scale, which number has the highest concentration of hydrogen ions? A. pH 1 B. pH 5 C. pH 7 D. pH 10</p>
<p class="answer">Answer is pH 1</p>
<p class="answer">Hydrogen ions = Acidic</p>
<p class="highlight">Remember this</p>
<p class="answer">Hydroxide ions = Basic</p>
<p class="answer">Hydrogen ions = Acidic</p>
<p class="answer">To remember, hydroxide has an X, which comes late in the alphabet, so Acidic (0-6) then Basic (7-14)</p>

<p class="answer">• ATP synthesis – highly endergonic reaction due to negative charges on phosphate groups</p>
<p class="answer">• Just as opposite charges attract, like charges repel; great deal of energy is required to overcome repulsive force and form bond</p>
<p class="answer">• Hydrolysis of bond is highly exergonic because ADP is more stable than ATP</p>
<p class="answer">• Not stored significantly by cells; entire supply exhausted in 60–90 seconds; cells must continually replenish ATP supply</p>
