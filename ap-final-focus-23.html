<hr class="divider"><p class="question">how taste chemicals are transduced to electrical signal that is sent to the brain</p>
<p class="highlight">Short Summary</p>
<p class="answer">1. Taste depolarizes the cell</p>
<p class="answer">2. Voltage-gated calcium channels open > calcium enters the cell</p>
<p class="answer">3. Calcium ions trigger the release of neurotransmitters</p>
<p class="answer">4. the release produces an action potential in the axon of the sensory neuron</p>
<p class="highlight">Long explanation</p>
<p class="answer">1. Changes in ion movements depolarize the gustatory cell's plasma membrane</p>
<p class="answer">2. Depolarization of the membrane opens voltage-gated calcium channels, and calcium channels enter the cell.</p>
<p class="answer">3. The calcium trigger the release of neurotransmitters, which produce an action potential in the axon of the sensory neuron</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the gustatory pathway from the tongue to the brain</p>
<p class="highlight">Short Summary:</p>
<p class="answer">1. CN 7, 9 10 → Carry taste stimuli from the tongue → CNS →</p>
<p class="answer">2. to the medulla (solitary nucleus) →</p>
<p class="answer">3. to the thalamus →</p>
<p class="answer">4. to the primary gustatory cortex.</p>
<p class="highlight">Long summary:</p>
<p class="answer">1. Axons in the facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves carry taste stimuli from the tongue into the CNS.</p>
<p class="answer">2. Axons of these three nerves terminate in the solitary nucleus in the medulla oblongata by synapsing on the central sensory neurons.</p>
<p class="answer">3. Axons from the solitary nucleus synapse on neurons in the thalamus, which then send the taste signals to the primary gustatory cortex in the parietal lobe.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the 3 tissue layers of the eyeball and their basic functions</p>
<p class="answer">Fibrous layer – outer layer; protection and shapes the eye. Includes cornea and sclera</p>
<p class="answer">Vascular layer – middle layer; supplies blood and controls light entry. Includes choroid, ciliary body, iris, pupil, suspension ligaments.</p>
<p class="answer">Neural layer – inner layer; contains the retina that detects light and sends signals to the brain.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">how the pupil dilates and constricts</p>
<p class="highlight">Pupillary sphincter muscle – in iris</p>
<p class="answer">Contracts during parasympathetic stimulation</p>
<p class="answer">Reduces size of pupil</p>
<p class="answer">Restricts amount of light entering eyeball</p>
<p class="highlight">Pupillary dilator muscle –in iris</p>
<p class="answer">Contracts during sympathetic activation</p>
<p class="answer">Allows pupil to increase in size</p>
<p class="answer">More light enters eyeball</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the principles of light: refraction</p>
<p class="answer">Refraction of light also depends on angle that light strikes surface of object</p>
<p class="answer">• Greater angle causes greater refraction; curved surfaces bend light rays more at their edges</p>
<p class="answer">• Convex lens – causes light rays to bend inward, or converge as they</p>
<p class="answer">• Concave lens – causes light rays to diverge or spread out (unfocused)</p>
<p class="answer">• Focused - When rays converge on one point (focal point) said to be focused</p>
<p class="answer">FOCUSED ON RETINA - Clear vision requires that light rays are focused on retina (not in front or behind it)</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Most of eye’s refractive power occurs as light passes through ____: refractive index similar to water</p>
<p class="answer">Cornea</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">____ provides for fine tuning and refractive adjustment</p>
<p class="answer">Lens</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">how light is focused on the retina</p>
<p class="answer">Clear vision requires that light rays are focused on retina (not in front or behind it)</p>
<p class="answer">• This is a function of lens and cornea</p>
<p class="answer">• Most of eye’s refractive power occurs as light passes through cornea: refractive index similar to water</p>
<p class="answer">• Lens provides for fine tuning and refractive adjustment</p>
<p class="highlight">Distant objects: Emmetropic state – eye is relaxed and focusing on distant objects</p>
<p class="answer">• Lens is in normal flattened shape</p>
<p class="answer">•  Parallel light rays are minimally refracted by cornea and focused on retina</p>
<p class="highlight">Close objects: Light rays from objects closer to eye are more scattered</p>
<p class="answer">• need more refraction (greater than cornea can provide)</p>
<p class="answer">•  lens becomes more thickened (accommodation)</p>
<p class="answer">• refracts light more than flattened lens so more light rays are focused on retina</p>
<p class="highlight">Chatgpt Answer</p>
<p class="answer">1. Cornea does most of the focusing</p>
<p class="answer">• Light enters the eye</p>
<p class="answer">• Cornea bends (refracts) light the most</p>
<p class="answer">2. Aqueous humor helps guide light</p>
<p class="answer">• Chamber between cornea and lens</p>
<p class="answer">• Keeps shape + helps light travel smoothly</p>
<p class="answer">3. Lens fine-tunes the focus</p>
<p class="answer">• Changes shape to focus light</p>
<p class="answer">– Lens rounds to focus on near objects</p>
<p class="answer">– Lens flattens to focus on far objects</p>
<p class="answer">• This is called accommodation</p>
<p class="answer">4. Light passes through vitreous humor</p>
<p class="answer">• Gel that keeps the eyeball shape</p>
<p class="answer">• Carries light to the retina</p>
<p class="highlight">5. Light hits the retina (the target)</p>
<p class="answer">• Focused light must land on the fovea for sharp vision</p>
<p class="answer">• Photoreceptors (rods + cones) convert light → signals</p>
<p class="highlight">SUPER QUICK SUMMARY:</p>
<p class="answer">• Cornea = main focus</p>
<p class="answer">• Lens = fine focus</p>
<p class="answer">• Goal = land image on retina/fovea</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">how the lens changes shape</p>
<p class="answer">Ciliary body surrounding lens relaxes when viewing distant objects</p>
<p class="answer">•  Flattens lens, reducing its refractive capability</p>
<p class="answer">Ciliary body contracts when viewing nearby object; allows for accommodation</p>
<p class="answer">•   Thickens lens, increasing refractive power</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the photoreceptors anatomy and what they detect</p>
<p class="highlight">From Chatgpt</p>

<p class="answer">No color; low detail</p>
<p class="highlight">PowerPoint Answer:</p>
<p class="answer">1. Cones – function best in bright light for processing high-resolution color vision</p>
<p class="answer">2. Rods – do not detect colors; most sensitive in low light and as component of peripheral vision</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">how light is transduced on the photoreceptor cell (you do NOT need to know the second messenger specific steps)</p>
<p class="answer">DARKNESS: photoreceptor is depolarized → Photoceptor releases Glutamate > bipolar cell inhibited  Bipolar cells do not activate ganglion cell  → Ganglion cell does NOT fire a light-related action potential</p>
<p class="answer">LIGHT: photoreceptor hyperpolarizes → stops releasing Glutamate > stops inhibiting bipolar cell > Ganglion cells change firing rate → signal travels to brain</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">how images are processed in the retina in the dark and light</p>
<p class="highlight">Dark (no light):</p>
<p class="answer">1. Photoreceptor depolarized → releases glutamate onto bipolar cells</p>
<p class="answer">2. Glutamate inhibits bipolar cell</p>
<p class="answer">3. No action potential</p>
<p class="highlight">Light:</p>
<p class="answer">1. Photoreceptor hyperpolarized → stops glutamate</p>
<p class="answer">2. Bipolar cell activated →  Releases Neurotransmitters onto the retinal ganglion cell</p>
<p class="answer">3. Retinal Ganglion cell fires action potentials to the brain via the optic nerve</p>
<p class="highlight">Textbook Answer</p>
<p class="highlight">Dark:</p>
<p class="answer">1. The photoceptor depolarizes and releases glutamate onto bipolar cells</p>
<p class="answer">2. Glutamate inhibits the bipolar cells and reduces its release of neurotransmitters</p>
<p class="answer">3. The retinal ganglion cell does not produce an action potential</p>
<p class="highlight">Light</p>
<p class="answer">1. Light hyperpolarizes the photoreceptor, and it stops releasing glutamate</p>
<p class="answer">2. The bipolar cell is freed from inhibition and depolarizes, releasing neurotransmitters onto the retinal ganglion cell</p>
<p class="answer">3. The retinal ganglion cell produces action potentials that are sent to the brain via the optic nerve</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the visual pathway</p>
<p class="highlight">Chatgpt simplified:</p>
<p class="answer">1. Retina detects info from both visual fields.</p>
<p class="answer">2. Optic chiasm crosses nasal fibers so right field → left brain, left field → right brain.</p>
<p class="answer">3. Thalamus → primary visual cortex (occipital lobe) for final processing.</p>
<p class="highlight">Long Steps:</p>
<p class="answer">1. The retina of each eye detects visual stimuli from portions of the right and left visual fields.</p>
<p class="answer">2. Some visual stimuli cross at the optic chiasma so that all stimuli from the right visual field are processed by the left hemisphere, and stimuli from the left visual field by the right hemisphere.</p>
<p class="answer">3. Visual stimuli travel from the thalamus to the primary visual cortex in the medial portion of the occipital lobe.</p>
