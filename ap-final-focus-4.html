<p class="title">AP Final Core 4</p>

<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Sodium Potassium Pump</p>
<p class="answer">A type of active transport</p>
<p class="answer">USES ATP.</p>
<p class="answer">3 sodium OUT of the cell and 2 potassium IN to the cell</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Active Transport via Membrane Proteins - uniport, Symport, Antiport</p>
<p class="answer">Three types of pumps in plasma membrane:</p>
<p class="answer">• Uniport – transport single substance through membrane in one direction (into or out of cell)</p>
<p class="answer">• Symport – transport two or more substances through membrane in same direction (into or out of cell)</p>
<p class="answer">• Antiport – transport two or more substances in opposite directions through membrane</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Active Transport via Vesicles</p>
<p class="answer">Active transport using carrier proteins and channels is effective but has limitations; large polar macromolecules are too big to fit:</p>
<p class="answer">• Vesicles – small sacs filled with large molecules too big to transport by other means</p>
<p class="answer">• Enclosed in phospholipid bilayer; allows fusion with or formation from plasma membrane or other membrane-bound organelles</p>
<p class="answer">• Active transport process; requires energy from ATP</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Endocytosis and the 3 types</p>
<p class="answer">A type of active transport</p>
<p class="answer">• Endocytosis – fluid, molecules taken into cell</p>
<p class="answer">3 types of Endocytosis</p>
<p class="answer">1. Phagocytosis (“cell eating”) –cells ingest large particles like bacteria or dead or damaged cells or parts of cell</p>
<p class="answer">2. Pinocytosis (fluid-phase endocytosis or “cell drinking”) – cells engulf fluid droplets from E C F</p>
<p class="answer">3. Receptor-mediated endocytosis – special form of pinocytosis; receptors fill vesicles with specific molecule (cholesterol, hormones, iron)</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Exocytosis</p>
<p class="answer">A type of active transport</p>
<p class="answer">large molecules exit cell (secretion); vesicles fuse with plasma membrane, opening into ECF</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Primary and secondary transport</p>
<p class="answer">These are both active transport</p>
<p class="highlight">Primary Active Transport</p>
<p class="answer">Directly uses ATP</p>
<p class="answer">Pumps molecules against their gradient</p>
<p class="answer">Example: Sodium–potassium pump</p>
<p class="answer">Memory tip:</p>
<p class="answer">“Primary = ATP pump.”</p>
<p class="highlight">Secondary Active Transport</p>
<p class="answer">Does NOT use ATP directly</p>
<p class="answer">Uses the energy from one molecule moving down its gradient to push another against its gradient</p>
<p class="answer">Depends on gradients created by primary pumps</p>
<p class="answer">Two types:</p>
<p class="answer">Symport: both molecules move same direction</p>
<p class="answer">Antiport: molecules move opposite directions</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What does membrane-bound organelles mean? What 5 organelles are membrane found? What does Functions could be destructive to the rest of the cell mean?</p>
<p class="answer">separated from cytosol by membrane (compartmentalization);</p>
<p class="answer">mitochondria, peroxisomes, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes;</p>
<p class="answer">Functions could be destructive to the rest of the cell = These organelles contain chemicals or enzymes that would damage the cell if they weren’t kept inside their own membrane.</p>
