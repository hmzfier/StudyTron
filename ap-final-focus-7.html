<p class="title">AP Final Core 7</p>

<hr class="divider"><p class="question">How is epithelial tissues classified (2)</p>
<p class="answer">number of cell layers</p>
<p class="answer">shape of cells in those layers</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Simple Squamous Epithelium</p>
<p class="answer">Adapted for rapid diffusion of substances (oxygen, carbon dioxide, fluids, and ions)</p>
<p class="answer">in air sacs of lung, specific segments of kidney tubules, and lining blood vessels</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Simple cuboidal epithelium</p>
<p class="answer">single layer of cube-shaped cells with large central nucleus; Thin enough for rapid substance diffusion;</p>
<p class="answer">In segments of renal tubules, respiratory passages, ducts of many glands, and thyroid gland</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Simple columnar epithelium</p>
<p class="answer">single layer of rectangular-shaped cells with nuclei in basal portion of cell;</p>
<p class="answer">Often microvilli (small intestine) or cilia; (uterine tubes and segments of respiratory tract) on apical plasma membrane</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Pseudostratified columnar epithelium</p>
<p class="answer">appears layered because nuclei are at various heights;</p>
<p class="answer">Only one cell-layer thick with basal plasma membranes firmly in contact with basement membrane;</p>
<p class="answer">In segments of respiratory tract and nasal cavity; ciliated</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Keratinized stratified squamous epithelium</p>
<p class="answer">apical cellular layers are dead; lack nuclei; filled with protein keratin; makes tissue tough and resistant to friction;</p>
<p class="answer">FOUND in outer layers of skin.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium</p>
<p class="answer">apical cellular layers retain nuclei; still alive; in regions subjected to mechanical stress where surface must remain moist;</p>
<p class="answer">mouth, throat, esophagus, anus, and vagina</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Stratified cuboidal epithelium</p>
<p class="answer">rare in humans; two cell layers;</p>
<p class="answer">lines ducts of sweat glands</p>
<p class="answer">Stratified columnar epithelium</p>
<p class="answer">also rare in humans; few layers; apical layer is columnar and basal cell layer is cuboidal;</p>
<p class="answer">in male urethra, cornea of eye, and ducts of certain glands such as salivary glands</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Transitional epithelium</p>
<p class="answer">only in urinary system;</p>
<p class="answer">lines interior of kidney, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra;</p>
<p class="answer">cuboidal basal cell layers and dome-shaped apical cell layers in relaxed tissue; ability of apical cells to flatten allows tissues to stretch</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">For epithelial tissues, ECM is found in a thin basement membrane consists of what 2 components?</p>
<p class="answer">Basal lamina – ECM synthesized by epithelial cells; consists of collagen fibers and ground substance</p>
<p class="answer">Reticular lamina – synthesized by underlying connective tissue; consists of reticular fibers and ground substance</p>
