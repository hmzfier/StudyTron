<p class="answer">Location: Heart (pericardium), lungs (pleura), abdomen (peritoneum)</p>
<p class="highlight">3. Cutaneous Membrane</p>
<p class="answer">Refers to skin; largest organ of body; consists of</p>
<p class="highlight">Epidermis</p>
<p class="answer">Outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium; tough, continuous protective surface; protects structures deep to it.</p>
<p class="highlight">Dermis</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Layer of loose connective tissue beneath epidermis plus deeper layer of dense irregular connective tissue</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Home to many blood vessels; provides means for oxygen and nutrients to diffuse into avascular epidermis</p>
<p class="answer">Structure: Keratinized stratified squamous epithelium (epidermis) + dense connective tissue (dermis)</p>
<p class="answer">Function: Protection, barrier against pathogens, prevents water loss</p>
<p class="answer">Location: Skin (covers the body)</p>
<p class="highlight">4. Synovial Membrane</p>
<p class="answer">line cavities surrounding freely moveable joints (knee or shoulder);</p>
<p class="answer">Structure: Connective tissue only (no epithelium)</p>
<p class="answer">Function: Secretes synovial fluid to lubricate joints</p>
<p class="answer">Location: Joint cavities (knees, shoulders, elbows)</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the location, structure and function of the hypodermis</p>
<p class="answer">Not part of skin; anchors skin to deeper structures like muscle and bone</p>
<p class="highlight">Location</p>
<p class="answer">Deepest layer under the dermis</p>
<p class="answer">Between skin and underlying muscles/bones</p>
<p class="highlight">Structure</p>
<p class="answer">Made of loose connective and adipose tissues; has abundant blood supply</p>
<p class="highlight">Functions</p>
<p class="answer">Insulation (keeps body heat)</p>
<p class="answer">Energy storage (fat reserve)</p>
<p class="answer">Cushioning/shock absorption</p>
<p class="answer">Anchors skin to underlying structures</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the functions of the integumentary system</p>
<p class="answer">Protection - physical barrier against injury, pathogens, UV</p>
<p class="answer">Sensation - touch, pressure, pain, temperature receptors</p>
<p class="answer">Temperature regulation - sweat, blood vessel dilation/constriction</p>
<p class="answer">Excretion - sweat removes salts, urea, wastes</p>
<p class="answer">Vitamin D Synthesis - skin makes vitamin D with UV exposure</p>
<p class="answer">Water balance - prevents water loss, controls absorption</p>
<p class="answer">Immune defense - Langerhans cells in the skin fight microbes</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the role of keratinocytes in the epidermis</p>
<p class="answer">Manufacture keratin – tough fibrous protein;</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the structure and function of the layers of the epidermis</p>
<p class="highlight">1. Stratum Basale (bottom layer)</p>
<p class="answer">Structure: single row of stem cells + melanocytes</p>
<p class="answer">Function:</p>
<p class="answer">Closest cells to dermal blood supply; most metabolically and mitotically active strata</p>
<p class="answer">Responsible for Vitamin D synthesis and replacement of dead keratinocytes (lost from superficial layers</p>
<p class="highlight">2. Stratum Spinosum</p>
<p class="answer">thickest layer; metabolically and mitotically active</p>
<p class="answer">Structure: several layers of keratinocytes with “spiny” connections; Langerhans cells</p>
<p class="answer">Function: strength + flexibility; immune defense</p>
<p class="highlight">3. Stratum Granulosum</p>
<p class="answer">Structure: 3–5 layers; keratinocytes filled with keratin + waterproofing lipids</p>
<p class="answer">Function: waterproof barrier; cells start dying</p>
<p class="highlight">4. Stratum Lucidum</p>
<p class="answer">only in thick skin: palms, soles</p>
<p class="answer">Structure: thin, clear layer of dead keratinocytes</p>
<p class="answer">Function: extra protection + reduces friction</p>
<p class="highlight">5. Stratum Corneum</p>
<p class="answer">top layer</p>
<p class="answer">Structure: outermost layer; several layers of dead, flattened keratinocytes with thickened plasma membranes, filled with keratin bundles (little else)</p>
<p class="answer">Function: main protective barrier; prevents water loss; resists abrasion</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the other cells of the epidermis and their function</p>
<p class="highlight">1. Melanocytes</p>
<p class="answer">Function: make melanin → protects against UV + gives skin color</p>
<p class="answer">in stratum basale;</p>
<p class="highlight">2. Langerhans cells (dendritic cells)</p>
<p class="answer">Function: immune defense → detect and fight pathogens</p>
<p class="highlight">3. Merkel cells</p>
<p class="answer">Function: touch receptors → detect light touch/pressure</p>
<p class="answer">Large numbers in regions specialized for touch: fingertips, lips, and at base of hairs</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the structure and function of the 2 layers of the dermis</p>
<p class="answer">1. Papillary Layer</p>
<p class="answer">superficial</p>
<p class="answer">Structure: thin; loose areolar connective tissue; dermal papillae; capillaries; sensory receptors</p>
<p class="answer">Also contains tactile (meissner) corpuscles)</p>
<p class="answer">Function: nourishes epidermis; supports/anchors it; provides touch sensation; increases surface area for nutrient exchange</p>
<p class="answer">2. Reticular Layer</p>
<p class="answer">deep thicker layer; separates dermis from hypodermis; mostly dense irregular connective tissue;</p>
<p class="answer">Structure: thick; dense irregular connective tissue; collagen + elastic fibers; glands; hair follicles; blood vessels</p>
<p class="answer">Function: strength + elasticity; houses accessory structures (glands, follicles); provides structural support and flexibility</p>
<p class="answer">Proteoglycans  - Rich in proteoglycans that draw water into ground substance; keeps skin firm and hydrated</p>
<p class="highlight">Lamellated (Pacinian) corpuscles</p>
<p class="answer">sensory receptors ; respond mainly to changes in pressure and vibration</p>
<p class="answer">Blood vessels, sweat glands, hairs, sebaceous glands, and adipose tissue are also present</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Dermal papillae</p>
<p class="answer">tiny projections at surface of papillary layer where it contacts epidermis</p>
<p class="answer">Contain tiny blood vessels (capillaries) arranged in loops;</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Tactile (Meissner) corpuscles</p>
<p class="answer">also in dermal papillae</p>
<p class="answer">sensory receptors; respond to light touch stimuli</p>
<p class="answer">more numerous where sensation is primary function (skin of fingertips, lips, face, and external genitalia)</p>
