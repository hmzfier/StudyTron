<p class="subTopicHeader">Module 6.2: Microscopic Structure of Bone Tissue</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What makes bone’s extracellular matrix (ECM) unique?</p>
<p class="answer">It contains both inorganic and organic components that provide strength and flexibility.</p>
<p class="answer">Note: the bone ECM is inside the bone, and surrounds bone cells.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is the inorganic matrix of bone made of?</p>
<p class="answer">It is primarily composed of calcium and phosphorus salts that form hydroxyapatite crystals.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Why is the inorganic matrix important?</p>
<p class="answer">Provides hardness and compressive strength, allowing bones to support weight and resist compression.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is the organic matrix of bone called and what does it contain?</p>
<p class="answer">It is called osteoid and consists of collagen fibers and other ECM components.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Why is the organic matrix important?</p>
<p class="answer">Provides flexibility and tensile strength, preventing bones from being brittle and breaking easily.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are the three main types of bone cells?</p>
<p class="answer">Osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is the function of osteoblasts?</p>
<p class="answer">They are responsible for bone deposition, forming new bone tissue.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are osteocytes and how do they form?</p>
<p class="answer">They are mature osteoblasts that become trapped in the ECM they secreted, maintaining bone tissue.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is the function of osteoclasts?</p>
<p class="answer">They are responsible for bone resorption, breaking down bone tissue.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is compact bone primarily composed of?</p>

<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is the structure of spongy bone?</p>
<p class="answer">It has branching trabeculae that form a framework for bone marrow and is not composed of osteons.</p>
<p class="subTopicHeader">Module 6.3: Bone Formation: Ossification</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is the process by which bones form called?</p>
<p class="answer">Ossification, or osteogenesis.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is the first type of bone formed during ossification?</p>
<p class="answer">Primary bone, which is later replaced by stronger secondary bone.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is intramembranous ossification?</p>
<p class="answer">A process of bone formation that occurs within a membrane composed of embryonic mesenchyme.</p>
<p class="answer">Intramembranous ossification is another way bones form, but it’s different from endochondral ossification. Here’s a simple explanation:</p>
<p class="answer">Instead of starting as cartilage, some bones start as a soft layer of tissue called mesenchyme (this is like embryonic “connective tissue”).</p>
<p class="answer">This soft tissue turns directly into bone without first becoming cartilage.</p>
<p class="answer">This is how flat bones like your skull and clavicle (collarbone) form.</p>
<p class="answer">So in one sentence: Intramembranous ossification is when bone forms directly from a soft tissue membrane instead of from cartilage.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What type of bone forms first in intramembranous ossification?</p>
<p class="answer">Spongy bone forms first at the primary ossification center.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Which bones are formed by intramembranous ossification?</p>
<p class="answer">Many flat bones, including the skull and clavicles, during fetal development.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What happens after spongy bone forms in intramembranous ossification?</p>
<p class="answer">The periosteum differentiates, and then compact bone forms.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is endochondral ossification?</p>
<p class="answer">A process of bone formation that occurs within a hyaline cartilage model.</p>
<p class="answer">Endochondral ossification is basically how most of your bones grow from cartilage. Here’s a simple way to think about it:</p>
<p class="answer">Imagine your bones start out as soft cartilage shapes (like squishy molds).</p>
<p class="answer">Over time, this cartilage gets replaced by hard bone.</p>
<p class="answer">This is how long bones like your femur (thigh bone) or humerus (arm bone) grow.</p>
<p class="answer">So, in one sentence: Endochondral ossification is the process where cartilage is slowly turned into bone as you grow.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Where does ossification begin in endochondral ossification?</p>
<p class="answer">It begins with early compact bone forming in the bone collar.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What forms after the bone collar in endochondral ossification?</p>
<p class="answer">The inner early spongy bone forms.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What bones formed by endochondral ossification</p>
<p class="answer">Most bones of the body, except the skull and clavicles.</p>
<p class="subTopicHeader">Module 6.4: Bone Growth in Length and Width</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Where does longitudinal bone growth occur?</p>
<p class="answer">At the epiphyseal plate in long bones, which has five zones of cells.</p>
<p class="subTopicHeader">What are the 5 zones of endochondral ossification</p>
<p class="answer">The five zones of endochondral ossification (in a growing long bone’s epiphyseal plate) in order from epiphysis to diaphysis are:</p>
<p class="answer">1.Zone of Resting (Reserve) Cartilage – small, inactive chondrocytes that anchor the epiphyseal plate to the epiphysis.</p>
<p class="answer">2.Zone of Proliferation – chondrocytes divide rapidly, forming columns of stacked cells.</p>
<p class="answer">3.Zone of Hypertrophy – chondrocytes enlarge and mature.</p>
<p class="answer">4.Zone of Calcification – the cartilage matrix calcifies, chondrocytes begin to die.</p>
<p class="answer">5.Zone of Ossification – osteoblasts invade, lay down bone matrix, forming new bone.</p>
<p class="answer">This sequence is essential for longitudinal bone growth.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What happens when the epiphyseal plate fully ossifies?</p>
<p class="answer">Longitudinal bone growth stops and no further lengthening is possible.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">How do short, flat, irregular, and sesamoid bones grow?</p>
<p class="answer">They grow from their ossification centers through either endochondral or intramembranous ossification.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">How do bones grow in width?</p>
<p class="answer">Through appositional growth, where osteoblasts in the periosteum secrete new circumferential lamellae.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Which three hormones significantly affect bone growth?</p>
<p class="answer">Growth hormone, testosterone, and estrogen.</p>
<p class="subTopicHeader">Module 6.5: Bone Remodeling and Repair</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What two processes make up bone remodeling?</p>
<p class="answer">Bone deposition by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">How does mechanical tension affect bone remodeling?</p>
<p class="answer">Tension on a bone stimulates osteoblasts and bone deposition, while pressure stimulates osteoclasts and bone resorption.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Which hormones generally promote net bone deposition?</p>
<p class="answer">Vitamin D, testosterone, and estrogen.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Which dietary factors influence bone remodeling?</p>
<p class="answer">Adequate intake of calcium ions, vitamin D, vitamin C, vitamin K, and protein.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What does parathyroid hormone do in bone remodeling?</p>
<p class="answer">It stimulates osteoclasts, calcium absorption in the intestines, and calcium retention by the kidneys, raising blood calcium levels.</p>
<p class="answer">Chatgpt Explanation:</p>
<p class="answer">Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is like a bone manager for your body. Here’s a simple explanation:</p>
<p class="answer">PTH helps control calcium levels in your blood.</p>
<p class="answer">When blood calcium is low, PTH tells bone cells (osteoclasts) to break down some bone and release calcium into the blood.</p>
<p class="answer">It also helps your kidneys and intestines keep more calcium in the blood.</p>
<p class="answer">So basically: PTH makes sure your blood always has enough calcium by pulling it from bone when needed.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are the two main classifications of bone fractures?</p>
<p class="answer">Simple (closed) -bone breaks, skin and tissue around fracture remain intact</p>
<p class="answer">compound (open) - bone breaks, skin and tissues around fracture are damaged</p>
<p class="answer">Compound = higher risk of infection because the bone is exposed to the environment.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">How does bone fracture healing begin?</p>
<p class="answer">Chondroblasts secrete cartilage to form a soft callus.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What happens after the soft callus forms during bone healing?</p>
<p class="answer">Osteoblasts replace the soft callus with a bone callus made of primary bone.</p>

<p class="answer">They are responsible for muscle contraction.</p>
<p class="subTopicHeader">Module 10.2: Structure and Function of Skeletal Muscle Fibers</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are skeletal muscle fibers composed of?</p>
<p class="answer">Very long, striated, multinucleated voluntary muscle cells.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is Actin and Myosin?</p>
<p class="answer">Actin = a thin filament that forms the track along which myosin moves.</p>
<p class="answer">Myosin = a thick filament with heads that attach to actin and pull it inward using energy from ATP.</p>
<p class="answer">Together, they slide past each other (the sliding filament mechanism), causing the muscle to shorten and contract.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are T-tubules and terminal cisternae?</p>
<p class="answer">T-tubules are inward extensions of the sarcolemma that surround myofibrils, and the calcium-storing sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) swells at these junctions to form terminal cisternae.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are myofibrils made of?</p>
<p class="answer">Myofibrils are composed of myofilaments made up of contractile, regulatory, and structural proteins.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are the three types of myofilaments and their main proteins?</p>
<p class="answer">Thick filaments – myosin (contractile protein)</p>
<p class="answer">Thin filaments – actin (contractile) with troponin and tropomyosin (regulatory)</p>
<p class="answer">Elastic filaments – titin (structural protein)</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What causes the striations in skeletal muscle tissue?</p>
<p class="answer">The arrangement of myofilaments into repeating light and dark regions.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is the importance of Z-Lines?</p>
<p class="answer">It marks the end of one sarcomere and the start of the next.</p>
<p class="answer">It anchors the actin (thin) filaments, keeping the structure organized during muscle contraction.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are I bands and what do they contain?</p>
<p class="answer">Light regions of striations containing only thin filaments; each I band has a Z-disc in its middle.</p>
<p class="answer">shortens during contraction.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are A bands and what do they contain?</p>
<p class="answer">Dark regions of striations where thick and thin filaments overlap; the central area is the H zone, bisected by the M line.</p>
<p class="answer">This region stays the same length during contraction, helping maintain the overall structure while filaments slide past each other.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is the importance of H-zones?</p>
<p class="answer">It’s the area with only myosin (no overlap with actin).</p>
<p class="answer">The H-zone disappears during contraction as actin slides over myosin — a clear sign that the muscle is shortening.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is the importance of M-line?</p>
<p class="answer">It’s the center of the sarcomere, holding the myosin filaments in place.</p>
<p class="answer">It helps stabilize the thick filaments during contraction so the sliding motion stays coordinated.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is the sarcomere?</p>
<p class="answer">The functional unit of contraction, defined as the area between two Z-discs.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is the sliding-filament mechanism?</p>
<p class="answer">The process in which thick and thin filaments slide past one another during muscle contraction.</p>
<p class="answer">Longer answer:</p>
<p class="answer">During muscle contraction, the thin filaments (actin) slide past the thick filaments (myosin) inside each sarcomere.</p>
<p class="answer">This causes the sarcomere to shorten, and when many sarcomeres shorten together, the whole muscle contracts.</p>

<p class="subTopicHeader">Module 10.4: The Process of Skeletal Muscle Contraction and Relaxation</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Where does a motor neuron meet a skeletal muscle fiber?</p>
<p class="answer">At the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), which includes the axon terminal, synaptic cleft, and motor end plate.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are the three main phases of skeletal muscle contraction?</p>
<p class="answer">Excitation, excitation-contraction coupling, and contraction.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What happens during the excitation phase?</p>
<p class="answer">The axon terminal releases acetylcholine (ACh) into the synaptic cleft, which binds to receptors on the motor end plate and generates an end-plate potential.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What occurs during excitation-contraction coupling?</p>
<p class="answer">The end-plate potential triggers an action potential in the sarcolemma that travels down the T-tubules, opening calcium (Ca²⁺) channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and flooding the cytosol with Ca²⁺.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What happens when calcium ions enter the cytosol?</p>
<p class="answer">Ca²⁺ binds to troponin, allowing tropomyosin to move away from actin’s active sites so contraction can occur.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What occurs during the contraction phase?</p>
<p class="answer">ATP hydrolysis “cocks” the myosin head, enabling it to bind actin. The power stroke then pulls actin toward the sarcomere’s center.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are the two main components of muscle relaxation?</p>
<p class="answer">1. ACh is broken down in the synaptic cleft.</p>
<p class="answer">2. Ca²⁺ levels in the cytosol return to resting levels.</p>

<p class="answer">A twitch, which includes the latent period, contraction period, and relaxation period.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What determines the amount of tension generated by a muscle fiber?</p>
<p class="answer">The frequency of stimulation by the motor neuron and the resulting concentration of calcium ions (Ca²⁺).</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What happens when a muscle fiber is stimulated before the relaxation period ends?</p>
<p class="answer">Unfused tetanus occurs.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What happens when a muscle fiber is stimulated 80–100 times per second before the relaxation period begins?</p>
<p class="answer">Fused tetanus occurs.</p>
<p class="answer">It is a good thing, like for weight lifting.</p>
<p class="answer">Fused tetanus is when a muscle fiber is stimulated so rapidly (about 80–100 times per second) that it doesn’t have time to relax between contractions.</p>
<p class="answer">As a result, the individual twitches blend into one smooth, sustained contraction with maximum tension.</p>
<p class="answer">It’s the strongest, steady state of contraction a muscle can produce.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What does the length-tension relationship describe?</p>
<p class="answer">Maximal tension is produced when the sarcomere is at its optimal length.</p>

<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are the structural characteristics of smooth muscle cells?</p>
<p class="answer">Uninucleate, lack T-tubules, striations, and sarcomeres, and have a less extensive sarcoplasmic reticulum than skeletal muscle fibers.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What stimulates smooth muscle contraction?</p>
<p class="answer">The autonomic nervous system, stretch, hormones, and pacemaker cell activity.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">How is smooth muscle contraction activated?</p>
<p class="answer">Calcium (Ca²⁺) binds to calmodulin, which activates myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) to initiate crossbridge cycling.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">How does smooth muscle relax?</p>
<p class="answer">By removing calcium (Ca²⁺) from the cytosol.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are the 2 types of smooth muscle tissue?</p>
<p class="answer">Single-unit smooth muscle, which contracts as a single unit</p>
<p class="answer">multi-unit smooth muscle, which contracts independently.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">How are cardiac muscle cells connected and coordinated?</p>
<p class="answer">They are joined by intercalated discs and coordinated electrically by pacemaker cells.</p>
