<hr class="divider"><p class="question">The 3 function of joints</p>
<p class="answer">Movement and stability and growth of bones</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Synarthroses, Amphiarthroses, Diarthroses</p>
<p class="answer">Synarthroses: Immovable joints (e.g., sutures of the skull)</p>
<p class="answer">Amphiarthroses: Slightly movable joints (e.g., intervertebral discs, pubic symphysis)</p>
<p class="answer">Diarthroses: Freely movable joints (e.g., shoulder, hip)</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are fibrous joints made of?</p>
<p class="answer">Dense regular connective tissue</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What do synovial joints have on the surface?</p>
<p class="answer">Hyaline cartilage</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What covers the end of synovial joints?</p>
<p class="answer">Articular Cartilage</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What 4 things do synovial joints have and their functions</p>
<p class="answer">1. Joint cavity (synovial cavity) – space between articulating bones</p>
<p class="answer">2. Articular capsule: Has two layers: Outer fibrous layer – holds the bones together Inner synovial membrane – lines the inside (except over cartilage) and produces synovial fluid</p>
<p class="answer">3. Synovial fluid – thick liquid with 3 main functions</p>
<p class="answer">Lubrication – reduces friction between articulating surfaces</p>
<p class="answer">Transportation – moves nutrients and waste products in absence of blood vessels within joint</p>
<p class="answer">Shock absorption – helps to evenly distribute stress and force during movement</p>
<p class="answer">4. Articular Cartilage:</p>
<p class="answer">Covers the ends of bones, reduces friction and absorbs shock</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">The 4 stabilizing and supporting factors of synovial joints</p>
<p class="answer">Ligaments</p>
<p class="answer">Tendons</p>
<p class="answer">Muscle Tone</p>
<p class="answer">Bursae</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is muscle tone</p>
<p class="answer">the slight, constant contraction of muscles even when you’re not actively moving.</p>
<p class="answer">Muscle tone is what keeps the bones of a synovial joint stable and properly aligned.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What Is bursae</p>
<p class="answer">Fluid-filled sacs</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the 3 fibrous joints: what they are composed of, where to find them and motility</p>
<p class="answer">1. Sutures</p>
<p class="answer">immoveable</p>
<p class="answer">2. Syndesmoses</p>
<p class="answer">joint between tibia, fibula, ulna, and radius</p>
<p class="answer">bones joined by interosseous membrane or ligament composed of dense regular collagenous connective tissue</p>
<p class="answer">allows for small amount of movement (amphiarthroses)</p>
<p class="answer">3. Gomphoses</p>
<p class="answer">immoveable joint (synarthrosis) between each tooth and bony socket in jaw</p>
<p class="answer">periodontal ligament is strong fibrous membrane; links tooth firmly to jaw bone</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the 2 cartilaginous joints: what they are composed of, where to find them and motility</p>
<p class="answer">1. Synchondrosis – bones linked together by hyaline cartilage; synarthroses</p>
<p class="answer">Epiphyseal plates</p>
<p class="answer">First sternocostal joint and costochondral joints are synchondroses</p>
<p class="answer">2. Symphysis – bones united by fibrocartilaginous pad or plug</p>
<p class="answer">functionally amphiarthroses</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Which of the following joints is unique to the thumb?</p>
<p class="answer">Saddle joint</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">How do we classify joints?</p>
<p class="answer">both by structure and function</p>
