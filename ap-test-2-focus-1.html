<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are the main organs of the skeletal system?</p>
<p class="answer">Bones, joints, and other supporting structures.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are the functions of the skeletal system?</p>
<p class="answer">Protection, mineral storage, maintenance of acid-base homeostasis, blood cell formation, fat storage, movement, and support.</p>
<p class="answer">maintenance of acid-base homeostasis explained:</p>
<p class="answer">The skeletal system helps maintain acid-base homeostasis by releasing phosphate and carbonate ions from bones into the blood when it becomes too acidic, buffering excess hydrogen ions and keeping blood pH stable.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is periosteum?</p>
<p class="answer">A membrane that sits on top of hard, outer compact bone.</p>
<p class="answer">The outer layer contains blood vessels, nerves, and connective tissue.</p>
<p class="answer">The inner layer contains osteoblasts and osteoclasts.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is found in red bone marrow?</p>
<p class="answer">Hematopoietic tissue responsible for blood cell formation.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is found in yellow bone marrow?</p>
<p class="answer">Blood vessel, triglycerides and adipocytes for fat storage.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is the structure of spongy bone?</p>
<p class="answer">It has branching trabeculae that form a framework for bone marrow and is not composed of osteons.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is the process by which bones form called?</p>
<p class="answer">Ossification, or osteogenesis.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is intramembranous ossification?</p>
<p class="answer">A process of bone formation that occurs within a membrane composed of embryonic mesenchyme.</p>
<p class="answer">Intramembranous ossification is another way bones form, but it’s different from endochondral ossification. Here’s a simple explanation:</p>
<p class="answer">Instead of starting as cartilage, some bones start as a soft layer of tissue called mesenchyme (this is like embryonic “connective tissue”).</p>
<p class="answer">This soft tissue turns directly into bone without first becoming cartilage.</p>
<p class="answer">This is how flat bones like your skull and clavicle (collarbone) form.</p>
<p class="answer">So in one sentence: Intramembranous ossification is when bone forms directly from a soft tissue membrane instead of from cartilage.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What type of bone forms first in intramembranous ossification?</p>
<p class="answer">Spongy bone forms first at the primary ossification center.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Which bones are formed by intramembranous ossification?</p>
<p class="answer">Many flat bones, including the skull and clavicles, during fetal development.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What happens after spongy bone forms in intramembranous ossification?</p>
<p class="answer">The periosteum differentiates, and then compact bone forms.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is endochondral ossification?</p>
<p class="answer">A process of bone formation that occurs within a hyaline cartilage model.</p>
<p class="answer">Endochondral ossification is basically how most of your bones grow from cartilage. Here’s a simple way to think about it:</p>
<p class="answer">Imagine your bones start out as soft cartilage shapes (like squishy molds).</p>
<p class="answer">Over time, this cartilage gets replaced by hard bone.</p>
<p class="answer">This is how long bones like your femur (thigh bone) or humerus (arm bone) grow.</p>
<p class="answer">So, in one sentence: Endochondral ossification is the process where cartilage is slowly turned into bone as you grow.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Where does ossification begin in endochondral ossification?</p>
<p class="answer">It begins with early compact bone forming in the bone collar.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What bones formed by endochondral ossification</p>
<p class="answer">Most bones of the body, except the skull and clavicles.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are the 5 zones of endochondral ossification</p>
<p class="answer">The five zones of endochondral ossification (in a growing long bone’s epiphyseal plate) in order from epiphysis to diaphysis are:</p>
<p class="answer">1. Zone of Resting (Reserve) Cartilage – small, inactive chondrocytes that anchor the epiphyseal plate to the epiphysis.</p>
<p class="answer">2. Zone of Proliferation – chondrocytes divide rapidly, forming columns of stacked cells.</p>
<p class="answer">3. Zone of Hypertrophy – chondrocytes enlarge and mature.</p>
<p class="answer">4. Zone of Calcification – the cartilage matrix calcifies, chondrocytes begin to die.</p>
<p class="answer">5. Zone of Ossification – osteoblasts invade, lay down bone matrix, forming new bone.</p>
<p class="answer">This sequence is essential for longitudinal bone growth.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What does parathyroid hormone do in bone remodeling?</p>
<p class="answer">It stimulates osteoclasts, calcium absorption in the intestines, and calcium retention by the kidneys, raising blood calcium levels.</p>
<p class="answer">Chatgpt Explanation:</p>
<p class="answer">Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is like a bone manager for your body. Here’s a simple explanation:</p>
<p class="answer">PTH helps control calcium levels in your blood.</p>
<p class="answer">When blood calcium is low, PTH tells bone cells (osteoclasts) to break down some bone and release calcium into the blood.</p>
<p class="answer">It also helps your kidneys and intestines keep more calcium in the blood.</p>
<p class="answer">So basically: PTH makes sure your blood always has enough calcium by pulling it from bone when needed.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are the two main classifications of bone fractures?</p>
<p class="answer">Simple (closed) -bone breaks, skin and tissue around fracture remain intact</p>
<p class="answer">compound (open) - bone breaks, skin and tissues around fracture are damaged</p>
<p class="answer">Compound = higher risk of infection because the bone is exposed to the environment.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">How does bone fracture healing begin?</p>
<p class="answer">Chondroblasts secrete cartilage to form a soft callus.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is Hydroxyapatite? What is it made of?</p>
<p class="answer">Hydroxyapatite is a crystalline mineral compound that makes up the inorganic (non-living) portion of bone.</p>
<p class="answer">It gives bones their hardness and strength.</p>
<p class="answer">Made of calcium, phosphate, hydroxide</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Intramembranous Ossification Steps (6)</p>
<p class="answer">Bone develops directly from mesenchymal (embryonic connective tissue) cells — no cartilage model first.</p>
<p class="answer">1. Mesenchymal cells cluster → form an ossification center.</p>
<p class="answer">2. Cells become osteoblasts → start secreting bone matrix (osteoid).</p>
<p class="answer">3.Osteoid calcifies → calcium is deposited, and the tissue hardens.</p>
<p class="answer">4. Osteoblasts become osteocytes → trapped in small spaces called lacunae.</p>
<p class="answer">5. Bone grows outward → forming trabeculae (spongy bone).</p>
<p class="answer">6. Periosteum forms on the outside → and compact bone develops around the spongy bone.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Endochondral Ossification Steps (8)</p>
<p class="answer">Bone forms by replacing a cartilage model (specifically hyaline cartilage).</p>
<p class="answer">1. Cartilage model forms from mesenchyme.</p>
<p class="answer">2. Cartilage grows in size as the model for the future bone.</p>
<p class="answer">3. Cartilage cells (chondrocytes) die in the center → space forms for bone to grow.</p>
<p class="answer">4. Blood vessels enter → bringing osteoblasts that start forming bone (primary ossification center in the diaphysis).</p>
<p class="answer">5. Bone tissue replaces cartilage in the shaft.</p>
<p class="answer">6. Secondary ossification centers form in the epiphyses (bone ends).</p>
<p class="answer">7. Epiphyseal plate (growth plate) remains between shaft and ends → allows the bone to grow in length until adulthood.</p>
<p class="answer">8. Epiphyseal plate ossifies → growth stops.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">The osteoclast can break down bone by secreting what 2 things?</p>

<p class="subTopicHeader">Module 10.2: Structure and Function of Skeletal Muscle Fibers</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is Actin and Myosin?</p>
<p class="answer">Actin = a thin filament that forms the track along which myosin moves.</p>
<p class="answer">Myosin = a thick filament with heads that attach to actin and pull it inward using energy from ATP.</p>
<p class="answer">Together, they slide past each other (the sliding filament mechanism), causing the muscle to shorten and contract.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are T-tubules and terminal cisternae?</p>
<p class="answer">T-tubules are inward extensions of the sarcolemma that surround myofibrils, and the calcium-storing sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) swells at these junctions to form terminal cisternae.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are the three types of myofilaments and their main proteins?</p>
<p class="answer">Thick filaments – myosin (contractile protein)</p>
<p class="answer">Thin filaments – actin (contractile) with troponin and tropomyosin (regulatory)</p>
<p class="answer">Elastic filaments – titin (structural protein)</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is the importance of Z-disc?</p>
<p class="answer">Line bisecting the I band.</p>
<p class="answer">Both the thin and elastic filaments anchor to the z-discs, which also attach myofibrils to one another</p>

<p class="answer">The middle portion of the A band in which only thick filaments are found</p>
<p class="answer">KNOW THAT IT IS IN THE A BAND. HA! acronym</p>
<p class="answer">The H-zone disappears during contraction as actin slides over myosin — a clear sign that the muscle is shortening.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is the importance of M-line?</p>
<p class="answer">Middle line of the A band. Contains structural proteins that hold thick filament in place</p>
<p class="answer">It helps stabilize the thick filaments during contraction so the sliding motion stays coordinated.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is the sarcomere?</p>
<p class="answer">The functional unit of contraction, defined as the area between two Z-discs.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is the sliding-filament mechanism?</p>
<p class="answer">The process in which thick and thin filaments slide past one another during muscle contraction.</p>
<p class="answer">Longer answer:</p>
<p class="answer">During muscle contraction, the thin filaments (actin) slide past the thick filaments (myosin) inside each sarcomere.</p>
<p class="answer">This causes the sarcomere to shorten, and when many sarcomeres shorten together, the whole muscle contracts.</p>
<p class="subTopicHeader">Module 10.3: Skeletal Muscle Fibers as Electrically Excitable Cells</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is the electrical gradient across the sarcolemma called?</p>
<p class="answer">The membrane potential</p>
<p class="answer">Explanation:</p>
<p class="answer">The inside of the cell is slightly negative compared to the outside, which is positive.</p>
<p class="answer">This difference in charge is created by ions (like sodium, potassium, and chloride) moving in and out through channels in the membrane (the sarcolemma in muscle cells).</p>
<p class="answer">Simply way to remember it:</p>
<p class="answer">Membrane potential = tiny battery in the cell membrane.</p>
<p class="answer">It stores electrical energy that’s used to start muscle contraction</p>
<p class="answer">In short:</p>
<p class="answer">The membrane potential is the electrical difference across the sarcolemma that allows a muscle cell to become excited and contract.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is the resting membrane potential of an unstimulated muscle fiber?</p>
<p class="answer">About -90 mV.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are the two main types of ion channels in the sarcolemma?</p>
<p class="answer">1. Leak channels = always open</p>
<p class="answer">Function = maintain resting membrane potential</p>
<p class="answer">2. Gated channels = opens in response to stimulus</p>
<p class="answer">Enable action potentials and muscle contraction</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Where are sodium and potassium ions most concentrated?</p>
<p class="answer">Sodium (Na⁺) concentration is higher in the extracellular fluid, while potassium (K⁺) concentration is higher in the cytosol.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What maintains the sodium and potassium ion gradient?</p>
<p class="answer">The sodium-potassium pump.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What causes the negative resting membrane potential?</p>
<p class="answer">The continuous loss of potassium through leak channels and the activity of sodium potassium pumps.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What forces drive ion movement across the sarcolemma?</p>
<p class="answer">1. Concentration Gradient</p>
<p class="answer">Ions naturally move from areas of high concentration → low concentration (like diffusion).</p>
<p class="answer">Example:</p>
<p class="answer">There’s more sodium outside the cell than inside → sodium tends to move into the cell.</p>
<p class="answer">There’s more potassium inside the cell → potassium tends to move out of the cell.</p>
<p class="answer">2. Electrical Gradient</p>
<p class="answer">Because ions are charged, they’re also influenced by electric charge differences across the membrane.</p>
<p class="answer">The inside of a resting muscle cell is negatively charged compared to the outside.</p>
<p class="answer">So:</p>
<p class="answer">Positive ions (sodium, calcium) are pulled into the negatively charged inside.</p>
<p class="answer">Negative ions (like Cl⁻) are pushed out.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is an action potential?</p>
<p class="answer">An action potential is a brief electrical signal that travels along the membrane of a nerve or muscle cell — it’s how cells communicate and trigger responses, like muscle contraction.</p>
<p class="answer">A temporary, rapid reversal of the membrane potential consisting of 3 things:</p>
<p class="answer">1. Depolarization - Sodium enters, making the membrane positive</p>
<p class="answer">2. Repolarization - Potassium exits the fiber, returning it to resting state</p>
<p class="answer">3. Return to rest - The sodium–potassium pump restores the original ion balance</p>
<p class="subTopicHeader">Module 10.4: The Process of Skeletal Muscle Contraction and Relaxation</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Where does a motor neuron meet a skeletal muscle fiber?</p>
<p class="answer">At the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), which includes the axon terminal, synaptic cleft, and motor end plate.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Short summary of muscle contraction</p>
<p class="answer">1. Excitation - Nerve signal releases ACh, starting an action potential in the muscle.</p>
<p class="answer">2. Excitation-contraction coupling - Action potential travels through T-tubules, causing the sarcoplasmic reticulumto release calcium.</p>
<p class="answer">3. Preparation for contraction - Calcium binds to troponin, moving tropomyosin to expose actin sites.</p>
<p class="answer">4. Contraction - Myosin heads binds to actin and pulls to the center of the Sarcomere. Cycle repeats leading to muscle contraction.</p>
<p class="answer">5. Relaxation - Calcium returns to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, ACh breaks down, and the muscle relaxes.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Long answer of what happens when you decide to move. Example: dumbbel curl</p>
<p class="answer">Here’s the full process of what happens when you do a dumbbell curl — from brain signal to muscle movement:</p>
<p class="answer">1. Brain sends the signal</p>
<p class="answer">Your brain’s motor cortex decides to lift the dumbbell and sends an electrical signal down your spinal cord and through motor neurons to your biceps brachii.</p>
<p class="answer">2. EXCITATION - Nerve reaches the muscle (neuromuscular junction)</p>
<p class="answer">At the neuromuscular junction, the nerve ending releases a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine (ACh) into the synaptic cleft.</p>
<p class="answer">3. EXCITATION - Action potential in the muscle fiber</p>
<p class="answer">ACh binds to receptors on the sarcolemma (muscle cell membrane), causing sodium ions (Na⁺) to rush in.</p>
<p class="answer">This changes the electrical charge, generating an action potential that travels along the sarcolemma and down the T-tubules.</p>
<p class="answer">4. EXCITATION-CONTRACTION-COUPLING - Calcium release</p>
<p class="answer">The action potential triggers the sarcoplasmic reticulum (a calcium-storing structure) to release calcium ions (Ca²⁺) into the sarcoplasm (muscle cytoplasm).</p>
<p class="answer">5.  Preparation for contraction -Binding of calcium to troponin</p>
<p class="answer">Calcium binds to troponin, which is attached to tropomyosin on the actin filaments.</p>
<p class="answer">This moves tropomyosin out of the way, exposing the myosin-binding sites on actin.</p>
<p class="answer">6. Contraction -Cross-bridge formation</p>
<p class="answer">Myosin heads (on the thick filaments) attach to the exposed sites on actin (thin filaments), forming cross-bridges.</p>
<p class="answer">7. Contraction -Power stroke</p>
<p class="answer">Each myosin head pivots using energy from ATP, pulling the actin filament toward the center of the sarcomere — this shortens the muscle fiber.</p>
<p class="answer">→ This is what causes your biceps to contract and lift the dumbbell upward.</p>
<p class="answer">8. Detachment and resetting</p>
<p class="answer">A new ATP molecule binds to the myosin head, causing it to detach from actin.</p>
<p class="answer">The ATP is then broken down into ADP + Pi, re-cocking the myosin head for another power stroke if calcium is still present.</p>
<p class="answer">9. Relaxation</p>
<p class="answer">When you lower the dumbbell:</p>
<p class="answer">The brain stops sending the signal.</p>
<p class="answer">ACh is broken down by acetylcholinesterase.</p>
<p class="answer">Calcium is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum.</p>
<p class="answer">Tropomyosin covers the binding sites again.</p>
<p class="answer">The muscle fiber relaxes and returns to its resting length.</p>
<p class="answer">In summary:</p>
<p class="answer">Brain → Nerve → ACh release → Action potential → Calcium release → Actin–myosin interaction → Contraction → Relaxation.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What happens during the excitation phase?</p>
<p class="answer">Short summary:  A nerve impulse (action potential) goes to the NMJ → ACh release → Sodium channels opens > action potential begins</p>
<p class="answer">1. A nerve impulse (action potential) travels down a motor neuron to the neuromuscular junction.</p>
<p class="answer">2. The neuron releases acetylcholine (ACh) into the synaptic cleft.</p>
<p class="answer">3. ACh binds to receptors on the sarcolemma (muscle fiber membrane).</p>
<p class="answer">4. This opens sodium (Na⁺) channels, causing depolarization of the muscle fiber — an action potential begins in the muscle.</p>
<p class="answer">Old summary:</p>
<p class="answer">The axon terminal releases acetylcholine (ACh) into the synaptic cleft, which binds to receptors on the motor end plate and generates an end-plate potential.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What occurs during excitation-contraction coupling?</p>
<p class="answer">Action Potential spreads → Calcium released in cytoplasm</p>
<p class="answer">1. The action potential spreads along the sarcolemma and down the T-tubules.</p>
<p class="answer">2. This triggers the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) to release calcium ions (Ca²⁺) into the cytoplasm.</p>
<p class="answer">3. Calcium binds to troponin on the thin filaments (actin), causing tropomyosin to move and expose myosin-binding sites on actin.</p>
<p class="answer">Previous summary:</p>
<p class="answer">The end-plate potential triggers an action potential in the sarcolemma that travels down the T-tubules, opening calcium (Ca²⁺) channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and flooding the cytosol with Calcium.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What happens when calcium ions enter the cytosol?</p>
<p class="answer">Calcium binds to troponin</p>
<p class="answer">allowing tropomyosin to move away from actin’s active sites so contraction can occur.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What occurs during the contraction phase?</p>
<p class="answer">Cross bridge forms > ATP binds to myosin > cross bridge breaks > the cycle repeats as long as calcium and ATP are present > Sarcomeres shorten > muscle contracts</p>
<p class="answer">1. Myosin heads bind to actin (cross-bridge forms).</p>
<p class="answer">2. Myosin pulls actin toward the center of the sarcomere using ATP (the power stroke).</p>
<p class="answer">3. ATP binds again to myosin → cross-bridge breaks → the cycle repeats as long as calcium and ATP are present.</p>
<p class="answer">4. Sarcomeres shorten → the muscle contracts.</p>
<p class="answer">Previous answer:</p>
<p class="answer">ATP hydrolysis “cocks” the myosin head, enabling it to bind actin. The power stroke then pulls actin toward the sarcomere’s center.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is a cross bridge and what is the cross-bridge cycle</p>
<p class="answer">A cross bridge is the connection (link) that forms between a myosin head and an actin filament during muscle contraction.</p>
<p class="answer">It’s called a bridge because it literally connects the thick and thin filaments inside the muscle cell.</p>
<p class="answer">Cross-bridge cycle</p>
<p class="answer">1. Myosin head binds to actin → cross bridge forms.</p>
<p class="answer">2. Myosin pulls on actin (the power stroke) → actin slides toward the center of the sarcomere → muscle shortens.</p>
<p class="answer">3. ATP binds to myosin → the cross bridge breaks (myosin detaches from actin).</p>
<p class="answer">4. Myosin resets (ATP is used to “cock” the head back) → ready to form another bridge.</p>
<p class="answer">This repeats many times — like tiny rowing motions — to produce contraction.</p>
<p class="answer">Easy way to remember:</p>
<p class="answer">Cross bridge = Myosin grabs actin and pulls.</p>

<p class="subTopicHeader">Module 10.6: Muscle Tension at the Fiber Level</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is a single contraction-relaxation cycle of a muscle fiber called?</p>
<p class="answer">A twitch, which includes the latent period, contraction period, and relaxation period.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What determines the amount of tension generated by a muscle fiber?</p>
<p class="answer">The frequency of stimulation by the motor neuron and the resulting concentration of calcium ions.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What happens when a muscle fiber is stimulated before the relaxation period ends?</p>
<p class="answer">Unfused tetanus occurs.</p>
<p class="answer">Unfused tetanus is normal and healthy — it’s how your body produces smooth, controlled muscle contractions during regular activity.</p>
<p class="answer">If you get no relaxation, this can cause muscle fatigue or cramping.</p>
<p class="answer">Explanation:</p>
<p class="answer">What happens when a muscle fiber is stimulated before it fully relaxes?</p>
<p class="answer">If a second stimulus (nerve impulse) arrives before the muscle fiber has completely relaxed from the previous contraction, the new contraction starts on top of the previous one.</p>
<p class="answer">This causes the tension (force) in the muscle to increase — because calcium hasn’t been fully taken back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum yet, and the muscle is still partially contracted.</p>
<p class="answer">Unfused Tetanus Definition:</p>
<p class="answer">Unfused tetanus is when a muscle is stimulated repeatedly at a rate that is fast enough to produce partial summation of contractions, but slow enough that the muscle still relaxes slightly between stimuli.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What happens when a muscle fiber is stimulated 80–100 times per second before the relaxation period begins?</p>
<p class="answer">Fused tetanus occurs.</p>
<p class="answer">It is a good thing, like for weight lifting.</p>
<p class="answer">Fused tetanus is when a muscle fiber is stimulated so rapidly (about 80–100 times per second) that it doesn’t have time to relax between contractions.</p>
<p class="answer">As a result, the individual twitches blend into one smooth, sustained contraction with maximum tension.</p>
<p class="answer">It’s the strongest, steady state of contraction a muscle can produce.</p>
<p class="answer">During weight lifting:</p>
<p class="answer">When you lift a heavy weight, your brain sends rapid, continuous nerve impulses to your muscle fibers.</p>
<p class="answer">These signals come so fast that the fibers don’t get a chance to relax between them.</p>
<p class="answer">That produces a fused (complete) tetanus — a smooth, sustained, maximal contraction.</p>
<p class="answer">This allows you to generate maximum force to lift or hold the weight.</p>
<p class="answer">So yes — fused tetanus is what lets you push, pull, or lift with full strength.</p>
