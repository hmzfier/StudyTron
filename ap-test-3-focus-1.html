<p class="title">Test 3 Focus 1</p>

<hr class="divider"><p class="question">6.5 Neuron Components</p>
<p class="highlight">CNS:</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Nuclei – clusters of neuron cell bodies</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Tracts – bundles of axons</p>
<p class="highlight">PNS:</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Ganglia – clusters of neuron cell bodies</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Nerves – bundles of axons</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">8. the 2 types of neuroglial cells in PNS and their functions</p>
<p class="answer">Schwann cells — myelinate certain axons in the pns</p>
<p class="answer">Satellite cells — surround and support cell bodies</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">13. the 3 general phases of the Action potential and which channels are open or closed</p>
<p class="highlight">Depolarization: voltage-gated sodium channels open, potassium channels closed.</p>
<p class="answer">membrane potential rises toward zero; then becomes positive briefly Repol</p>
<p class="answer">Makes the membrane becomes more positive</p>
<p class="highlight">Repolarization: sodium channels inactivate, potassium channels open.</p>
<p class="answer">Makes the membrane return toward negative.</p>
<p class="highlight">Hyperpolarization: potassium channels still open briefly, sodium channels reset to closed.</p>
<p class="answer">Makes the membrane MORE negative than resting membrane potential.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">17. what a synapse is and the 3 places that it can occur</p>
<p class="answer">Synapse: a junction where a neuron communicates with another cell.</p>
<p class="answer">Three locations:</p>
<p class="answer">Axodendritic: axon → dendrite</p>
<p class="answer">Axosomatic: axon → soma (cell body)</p>
<p class="answer">Axoaxonic: axon → axon</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">20. the postsynaptic potentials (EPSP vs. IPSP)</p>
<p class="highlight">EPSP (excitatory postsynaptic potential): depolarizes the postsynaptic membrane, bringing it closer to threshold.</p>
<p class="answer">Ion channels open and positive charges enter the postsynaptic neuron, causing an EPSP</p>
<p class="highlight">IPSP (inhibitory postsynaptic potential): hyperpolarizes the postsynaptic membrane, moving it further from threshold.</p>
<p class="answer">Ion channels open and the postsynaptic neuron gains negative charges or loses positive charges, causing an IPSP</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">21. neural integration</p>
<p class="answer">the process of combining all excitatory and inhibitory inputs a neuron receives to determine whether it will fire an action potential.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">23. Compare and contrast temporal vs. spatial summation</p>
<p class="answer">Temporal summation: multiple signals from the same neuron arrive in rapid succession; effects add up over time.</p>
<p class="answer">Spatial summation: signals from multiple neurons arrive at the same time; effects add up across space.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">24. the 3 ways synaptic transmission is terminated</p>
<p class="answer">Reuptake – neurotransmitters are taken back into the presynaptic neuron.</p>
<p class="answer">Enzymatic degradation – enzymes break down neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft.</p>
<p class="answer">Diffusion – neurotransmitters drift away from the synaptic cleft and are returned to the presynaptic neuron</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">27. what neuronal circuits are</p>
<p class="answer">Short Answer: Neuronal circuits are networks of interconnected neurons that transmit and process signals to produce responses. They can be simple, like reflexes, or complex, like those for learning and memory, and involve sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons.</p>
<p class="answer">Long Answer:</p>
<p class="answer">Neuronal circuits are networks of interconnected neurons that work together to process specific types of information and generate responses. Essentially, they are the pathways through which signals travel in the nervous system to perform functions like sensing, thinking, moving, or regulating bodily processes.</p>
<p class="answer">Key points:</p>
<p class="answer">Components: Neurons (sensory, motor, interneurons), synapses, and sometimes supporting glial cells.</p>
<p class="answer">Function: Transmit and integrate electrical and chemical signals.</p>
<p class="answer">Types:</p>
<p class="answer">Simple circuits: Reflex arcs (e.g., knee-jerk reflex).</p>
<p class="answer">Complex circuits: Those in the brain for learning, memory, and higher-order processing.</p>
<p class="answer">Direction of flow: Signals usually move from sensory neurons → interneurons → motor neurons, but some circuits can be recurrent or feedback loops.</p>
<p class="answer">In short, neuronal circuits are the “wiring” of the nervous system that determines how information is processed and how the body responds.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">4. the location and function of the 5 lobes of the cerebrum</p>
<p class="highlight">1.Frontal lobe</p>
<p class="answer">Location: Central sulcus and precentral gyrus</p>
<p class="answer">Function: Responsible for planning and executing movement and complex mental functions such as behavior, conscience, and personality</p>
<p class="highlight">2.Parietal lobe</p>
<p class="answer">Location: top/back of the cerebrum</p>
<p class="answer">Function: Responsible for processing and integrating sensory information and function in attention</p>
<p class="highlight">3.Temporal lobe</p>
<p class="answer">Location: sides of the brain near the temples</p>
<p class="answer">Function: Involved in hearing, language, memory, and emotions</p>
<p class="highlight">4.Occipital lobe</p>
<p class="answer">Location: back of the brain</p>
<p class="answer">Function: Neurons process all information related to vision</p>
<p class="highlight">5.Insula (Insular lobe)</p>
<p class="answer">Location: deep inside the lateral sulcus, under the temporal and frontal lobes</p>
<p class="answer">Function: neurons are currently thought to be involved in functions related to taste and viscera (internal organs)</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">5. the 3 areas of the neocortex and their functions.</p>
<p class="highlight">1.Sensory areas</p>
<p class="answer">Receive and process sensory information</p>
<p class="answer">Examples: primary visual cortex, primary auditory cortex, primary somatosensory cortex</p>
<p class="highlight">2.Motor areas</p>
<p class="answer">Control voluntary movement</p>
<p class="answer">Example: primary motor cortex (initiates movement), premotor cortex (plans movement)</p>
<p class="highlight">3.Association areas</p>
<p class="answer">Integrate information, enable thinking, memory, language, problem-solving</p>
<p class="answer">Make up most of the cortex and connect sensory + motor functions</p>
