<p class="title">Test 3 Focus 3</p>

<hr class="divider"><p class="question">6. the motor areas of the cerebral cortex</p>
<p class="highlight">1.Primary Motor Cortex (precentral gyrus)</p>
<p class="answer">involved in conscious planning (voluntary) of movements.</p>
<p class="highlight">2.Premotor Cortex</p>
<p class="answer">involved in planning, guidance, coordination and execution of movement</p>
<p class="highlight">3. Frontal eye fields</p>
<p class="answer">involved in back and forth eye movements (as in reading)</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">7. the Cerebral cortex’s 2 main somatosensory areas</p>
<p class="answer">1.Primary Somatosensory Cortex (postcentral gyrus)</p>
<p class="answer">interprets incoming somatic sensory stimuli: touch, pressure, pain, temperature, proprioception.</p>
<p class="answer">2.Somatosensory Association Area</p>
<p class="answer">Integrates incoming somatic sensory stimuli  (recognizing objects by touch, understanding shape/texture).</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">8. where the special senses are located in the cerebral cortex</p>
<p class="answer">• Vision – primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe (calcarine sulcus).</p>
<p class="answer">• Hearing – primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe (superior temporal gyrus).</p>
<p class="answer">• Taste – primary gustatory cortex in the insula and frontal operculum.</p>
<p class="answer">• Smell (olfaction) – primary olfactory cortex in the medial temporal lobe (piriform cortex).</p>
<p class="answer">• Balance (vestibular sense) – vestibular cortex in the insula and parietal lobe.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">10. the basal nuclei location and function. Also how it prevents spontaneous, inappropriate muscle contractions (discussed later in the chap in 12.8)</p>
<p class="highlight">Location:</p>
<p class="answer">Deep inside the cerebrum, buried within the cerebral hemispheres.</p>
<p class="answer">They surround and flank the thalamus and include structures such as the caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus.</p>
<p class="highlight">Function:</p>
<p class="answer">• Regulate movement</p>
<p class="answer">• Start and stop voluntary movements smoothly</p>
<p class="answer">• Help with motor planning and coordination</p>
<p class="answer">• Suppress unwanted or inappropriate movements</p>
<p class="answer">• Influence posture and muscle tone</p>
<p class="answer">• Contribute to habit formation and certain cognitive functions</p>
<p class="highlight">How they prevent spontaneous, inappropriate muscle contractions:</p>
<p class="answer">The basal nuclei inhibit motor neurons at rest.</p>
<p class="answer">They do this by sending constant inhibitory signals (mainly GABA) to motor pathways.</p>
<p class="answer">This steady inhibition stops random or unintended muscle activity.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">11. the 3 types of white matter fibers and their functions</p>
<p class="answer">Association fibers – restricted to single hemisphere; connect gray matter of cortical gyri with one another</p>
<p class="answer">Commissural fibers – connect the two hemispheres (e.g., corpus callosum).</p>
<p class="answer">Projection fibers –  connect cerebral cortex of one hemisphere with other areas of same hemisphere, other parts of brain, and spinal cord</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">13. For the diencephalon, know its location, the function of the thalamus and hypothalamus and pineal gland and subthalamus</p>
<p class="answer">Location of diencephalon: Deep in the brain, between the cerebrum and brainstem.</p>
<p class="answer">Thalamus: Main relay station for sensory information going to the cortex.</p>
<p class="answer">Hypothalamus:  perform several vital functions critical to survival (regulation of autonomic</p>
<p class="answer">nervous system, sleep/wake cycle, thirst and hunger, and body temperature)</p>
<p class="answer">Pineal gland: Produces melatonin and regulates sleep–wake cycles.</p>
<p class="answer">Subthalamus - functionally connected with basal nuclei; together control movement</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">14. the location and function of the cerebellum</p>
<p class="answer">Location: At the back of the brain, inferior to the cerebrum and posterior to the brainstem.</p>
<p class="answer">Function: Coordinates balance, posture, and smooth, precise voluntary movements.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">16. the location and function of the reticular formation</p>
<p class="answer">Location: A network of over 100 neurons running through the brainstem (midbrain, pons, medulla).</p>
<p class="highlight">Function:</p>
<p class="answer">▪Function in sleep, pain transmission, and mood</p>
<p class="answer">▪Serve motor functions for both skeletal muscles and autonomic nervous system</p>
<p class="answer">▪Involved in homeostasis of breathing and blood pressure</p>
<p class="answer">▪Play role in sensation and alertness and activity levels of cerebral cortex</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">17. how the endocrine and nervous system work together to help the body maintain homeostasis</p>
<p class="answer">The nervous system sends fast, short-term signals (nerve impulses), and the endocrine system sends slow, long-lasting signals (hormones).</p>
<p class="answer">They work together by detecting changes (nervous system) and correcting them through hormone release (endocrine system), keeping the body in homeostasis.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">20. the 2 main types of memory + classification based on duration of storage</p>
<p class="answer">Types of memory:</p>
<p class="answer">• Declarative (facts/events)</p>
<p class="answer">• Non-declarative (skills/habits)</p>
<p class="answer">By duration:</p>
<p class="answer">Immediate memory –critical for carrying out normal conversation, reading, and daily tasks</p>
<p class="answer">Short-term (working) memory – allows you toremember and manipulate info with general behavioral goal in mind</p>
<p class="answer">Long-term memory – more permanent form of storage for days, weeks, or even lifetime</p>
