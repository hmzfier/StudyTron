<p class="title">Test 3 Focus 5</p>

<hr class="divider"><p class="question">9. how we classify sensory receptors: forms, location, and stimulus that triggers depolarization.</p>
<p class="answer">Encapsulated nerve endings – surrounded by specialized supportive cells</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Like mechanoreceptors</p>
<p class="answer">Free nerve endings – lack supportive cells</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Like hair follicle on thin skin; temperature</p>
<p class="highlight">Sensory receptors can be sorted by location of stimuli they detect:</p>
<p class="answer">1. Exteroceptors –detect stimuli originating from outside body</p>
<p class="answer">2. Interoceptors –detect stimuli originating from within body itself</p>
<p class="highlight">Mechanoreceptors – encapsulated interoceptors or exteroceptors</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Found in musculoskeletal system, skin, and other organs</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Mechanically gated ion channels:depolarize when mechanically deformed</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Allow for sensory transduction from vibration, light touch, stretch, and pressure</p>
<p class="highlight">Thermoreceptors – exteroceptors</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Depolarize in response to temperature changes (separate receptors detect hot and cold)</p>
<p class="answer">▪▪ Slowly adapting receptors</p>
<p class="highlight">Chemoreceptors – can be either interoceptors or exteroceptors</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Depolarize in response to binding to specific chemicals (in body fluids or in air)</p>
<p class="highlight">Photoreceptors – special sensory exteroceptors found only in eye</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Depolarize in response to light</p>
<p class="highlight">Nociceptors – usually slowly adapting exteroceptors</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Depolarize in response to noxious stimuli</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">10. classes of mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, nociceptors</p>
<p class="highlight">MECHANORECEPTORS</p>
<p class="highlight">Lamellated corpuscles (Pacinian corpuscles) – layered onion-shaped appearance; rapidly adapting receptors deep within dermis; detect high-frequency vibratory and deep pressure stimuli</p>
<p class="highlight">Hair follicle receptors – free nerve endings at base of hair follicles in thin skin</p>
<p class="answer">• Respond to stimuli that cause hair to bend</p>
<p class="highlight">Proprioceptors – in musculoskeletal system</p>
<p class="answer">• Detect movement and position of joint or body part</p>
<p class="highlight">THERMORECEPTORS</p>
<p class="answer">Usually small knobs at end of free nerve endings in skin</p>
<p class="highlight">“Cold” receptors – respond to temperatures between 50–104°F; in superficial</p>
<p class="answer">Dermis</p>
<p class="highlight">“Hot” receptors – respond to temperatures between 90–118°F; deep in dermis</p>
<p class="answer">• Temperatures outside these ranges are detected by nociceptors</p>
<p class="answer">• • Reason extremes of temperature are interpreted as pain</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">11. what sensory nerve receptive fields and 2-points discriminations are</p>
<p class="answer">Receptive field: the area of skin that one sensory neuron monitors.</p>
<p class="answer">Two-point discrimination: how close two touches can be and still be felt as two separate points; smaller fields = better discrimination.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">12. Describe dermatomes and referred pain</p>
<p class="answer">Dermatomes: skin regions supplied by a single spinal nerve.</p>
<p class="answer">Referred pain: pain felt in a different area than the actual source because visceral and somatic nerves share spinal pathways.</p>
<p class="highlight">Powerpoint info on referred pain:</p>
<p class="answer">Referred pain – pain that originates in an organ is perceived as cutaneous pain</p>
<p class="answer">• Visceral sensations travel along same pathways as do somatic sensations</p>
<p class="answer">• Referred pain is generally located along dermatome for particular nerve</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">14. the 2 mechanoreceptors within muscles and tendons and how they function</p>
<p class="answer">Muscle spindles: detect muscle stretch; cause reflex contraction to prevent overstretching.</p>
<p class="answer">Golgi tendon organs: detect tendon tension; cause reflex relaxation to prevent excessive force.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">2. Be able to compare the Somatic and Autonomic Nervous Systems</p>
<p class="highlight">Somatic motor division</p>
<p class="answer">• Directly innervates their target</p>
<p class="answer">• Neurons innervate skeletal muscle</p>
<p class="answer">• Leads to voluntary muscle contractions</p>
<p class="highlight">Autonomic motor division</p>
<p class="answer">• Does not directly innervate their target and require two-neuron circuit</p>
<p class="answer">• Neurons innervate smooth muscle cells, cardiac muscle cells, and glands</p>
<p class="answer">• Produce involuntary actions</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">4. the Sympathetic Neurotransmitters and Receptors (you don’t need to know the receptors at the level of alpha1 and Beta1...just cholinergic and adrenergic)</p>
<p class="answer">Acetylcholine (ACh) –used in synapses between sympathetic preganglionic and postganglionic neurons</p>
<p class="answer">• postganglionic axons then transmit action potentials to target cell</p>
<p class="answer">• Neurotransmitters bind to specific receptors of target cells</p>
<p class="answer">1. Adrenergic receptors (α or β) bind to epinephrine & norepinephrine</p>
<p class="answer">2. Cholinergic receptors (Nicotinic & Muscarinic) bind to Acetylcholine</p>
<p class="answer">• Muscarinic receptors – on sweat glands in skin</p>
<p class="answer">• Nicotinic receptors – in membranes of all postganglionic neurons within sympathetic ganglia and adrenal medullae</p>
<p class="highlight">Chatpgpt Answer:</p>
<p class="answer">Preganglionic neuron: releases ACh → binds cholinergic receptors</p>
<p class="answer">Postganglionic neuron: usually releases NE → binds adrenergic receptors</p>
<p class="answer">Exception: sweat glands use ACh on cholinergic receptors</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">5. the effects of the Sympathetic Nervous System on the target cells</p>

<p class="answer">Cells of adrenal medulla: Release of epinephrine and norepinephrine.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">6. the relationship between the Adrenal Medulla and the Sympathetic Nervous System.</p>
<p class="answer">1. it prolongs the duration of the sympathetic nervous system’s effects.</p>
<p class="answer">2. The epinephrine and norepinephrine in the blood can reach cells that are not innervated by sympathetic neurons</p>
<p class="answer">3.The adrenal medulla acts as a “backup” for the sympathetic nervous system—even if the pathways connecting this system with many of its target organs are disrupted, it can still affect these organs indirectly via the adrenal medulla</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">7. the anatomy of the Parasympathetic Nervous System and how it’s organized.</p>
<p class="answer">craniosacral division - cranial and sacral</p>
<p class="highlight">Parasympathetic cranial nerves</p>
<p class="answer">associated with oculomotor (CN III), facial (CN VII), glossopharyngeal (CN IX), and vagus (CN X) nerves</p>
<p class="highlight">Vagus nerves – main parasympathetic nerves that innervate most thoracic and abdominal viscera; 90% of parasympathetic output</p>
<p class="answer">Contribute to cardiac, pulmonary, and esophageal plexuses</p>
<p class="highlight">Parasympathetic sacral nerves</p>
<p class="answer">innervate last segment of large intestine, urinary bladder, and reproductive organs.</p>
<p class="answer">Sacral nerve branches form pelvic splanchnic nerves; then form plexuses in pelvic floor</p>
