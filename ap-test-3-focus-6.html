<hr class="divider"><p class="question">2. olfaction anatomy</p>
<p class="answer">Basic Gist: Nerve > Bulb > Tract</p>
<p class="answer">Olfactory nerve (CN I) – combined axons of olfactory neurons</p>
<p class="answer">Olfactory bulb – sits above cribriform plate of ethmoid bone; below frontal lobe of brain</p>
<p class="answer">Mitral cells (neurons in olfactory bulb) axons form bulk of olfactory tract</p>
<p class="answer">Olfactory tract – axons that leave olfactory bulb and go to CNS for interpretation</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">3. the path from the olfactory nerve to olfactory bulb to olfactory tract to primary olfactory cortex</p>
<p class="highlight">Short summary</p>
<p class="answer">Neuron > Bulb > Mitral cells > Tract > Primary olfactory cortex</p>
<p class="highlight">Long Explanation</p>
<p class="answer">1. Olfactory neurons send signals to the olfactory bulb</p>
<p class="answer">2. Where they synapse with mitral cells. Mitral cell axons form the olfactory tract</p>
<p class="answer">3. which carries the signal to the primary olfactory cortex for odor awareness. From there, the limbic system (amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus) adds emotion and memory to the smell.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">5. the type of receptors that involved in gustatory sense</p>
<p class="answer">Chemoreceptors</p>
<p class="answer">It’s complicated!! – Involves olfactory chemoreceptors, thermoreceptors, nociceptors, and gustatory chemoreceptors (taste buds= found on tongue and other surfaces of oral cavity)</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">6. the anatomy of the taste bud</p>
<p class="answer">Taste buds – usually located on lateral surfaces of papillae</p>
<p class="highlight">Contain three cell types:</p>
<p class="highlight">1. Gustatory (taste) cells</p>
<p class="answer">▪ specialized epithelial cells with microvilli</p>
<p class="answer">▪ project into opening on papilla surface (taste pore)</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Have receptors that detect different tastes</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Carry taste stimuli to CNS via CN VII, CN IX, CN X</p>
<p class="highlight">2. Basal cells</p>
<p class="answer">stem cells differentiate into new gustatory cells live 10–14 days</p>
<p class="highlight">3. Supporting cells</p>
<p class="answer">▪ physically support gustatory cells</p>
<p class="answer">▪ no role in taste sensation</p>
<p class="highlight">Classified by shape:</p>
<p class="highlight">1. Vallate (circumvallate) papillae – largest, dome-shaped</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Contain 100s of taste buds</p>
<p class="highlight">2. Fungiform papillae – mushroom-shaped</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Contain few taste buds</p>
<p class="highlight">3. Foliate papillae – ridges on sides of tongue</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Only contain taste buds in childhood</p>
<p class="highlight">4. Filiform papillae – long, thin cylinders scattered across tongue</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Devoid of taste buds</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Contain sensory nerve endings to detect food texture and temperature</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">7. the cranial nerves that are associated with gustation</p>
<p class="answer">Cranial nerves for taste: VII (facial), IX (glossopharyngeal), and X (vagus).</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">12. the 3 tissue layers of the eyeball and their basic functions</p>
<p class="answer">Fibrous layer – outer layer; protection and shapes the eye. Includes cornea and sclera</p>
<p class="answer">Vascular layer – middle layer; supplies blood and controls light entry. Includes choroid, ciliary body, iris, pupil, suspension ligaments.</p>
<p class="answer">Neural layer – inner layer; contains the retina that detects light and sends signals to the brain.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">13. how the pupil dilates and constricts</p>
<p class="highlight">Pupillary sphincter muscle – in iris</p>
<p class="answer">Contracts during parasympathetic stimulation</p>
<p class="answer">Reduces size of pupil</p>
<p class="answer">Restricts amount of light entering eyeball</p>
<p class="highlight">Pupillary dilator muscle –in iris</p>
<p class="answer">Contracts during sympathetic activation</p>
<p class="answer">Allows pupil to increase in size</p>
<p class="answer">More light enters eyeball</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">14. the eyeball cavities and what structures are found in all of them</p>
<p class="highlight">Posterior cavity –filled with vitreous humor</p>
<p class="answer">• Vitreous humor– made mostly of collagen and water</p>
<p class="answer">• • Presses retina against choroid</p>
<p class="answer">• • Helps maintain eyeball shape</p>
<p class="highlight">Anterior cavity –2 chambers filled with aqueous humor</p>
<p class="answer">• Posterior chamber – between lens and iris</p>
<p class="answer">• Anterior chamber – between iris and cornea</p>
<p class="answer">• Aqueous humor – watery fluid secreted by ciliary body</p>
<p class="answer">• •  Flows from posterior chamber through pupil into anterior chamber</p>
<p class="answer">• • Drained from anterior cavity into scleral venous sinus</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">16. how light is focused on the retina</p>
<p class="answer">Clear vision requires that light rays are focused on retina (not in front or behind it)</p>
<p class="answer">• This is a function of lens and cornea</p>
<p class="answer">• Most of eye’s refractive power occurs as light passes through cornea: refractive index similar to water</p>
<p class="answer">• Lens provides for fine tuning and refractive adjustment</p>
<p class="highlight">Distant objects: Emmetropic state – eye is relaxed and focusing on distant objects</p>
<p class="answer">• Lens is in normal flattened shape</p>
<p class="answer">•  Parallel light rays are minimally refracted by cornea and focused on retina</p>
<p class="highlight">Close objects: Light rays from objects closer to eye are more scattered</p>
<p class="answer">• need more refraction (greater than cornea can provide)</p>
<p class="answer">•  lens becomes more thickened (accommodation)</p>
<p class="answer">• refracts light more than flattened lens so more light rays are focused on retina</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">17. how the lens changes shape</p>
<p class="answer">Ciliary body surrounding lens relaxes when viewing distant objects</p>
<p class="answer">•  Flattens lens, reducing its refractive capability</p>
<p class="answer">Ciliary body contracts when viewing nearby object; allows for accommodation</p>
<p class="answer">•   Thickens lens, increasing refractive power</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">18. the 4 errors of refraction and how they can be corrected</p>
<p class="highlight">Chatgpt answer (better)</p>
<p class="highlight">Myopia (nearsighted)</p>
<p class="answer">Eye too long / light focuses in front of retina</p>
<p class="answer">Correct with concave (minus) lens</p>
<p class="highlight">Hyperopia (farsighted)</p>
<p class="answer">Eye too short / light focuses behind retina</p>
<p class="answer">Correct with convex (plus) lens</p>
<p class="highlight">Astigmatism</p>
<p class="answer">Uneven curvature of cornea/lens</p>
<p class="answer">Correct with cylindrical lens</p>
<p class="highlight">Presbyopia</p>
<p class="answer">Lens loses flexibility with age</p>
<p class="answer">Correct with reading glasses or bifocals</p>
<p class="highlight">Powerpoint Answer</p>
<p class="highlight">Presbyopia -closest point at which eye can focus on an object; increases with age</p>
<p class="answer">Lens becomes less flexible</p>
<p class="answer">Difficulty reading</p>
<p class="answer">Corrected with reading glasses or bifocals (glasses with one set of lenses for distance vision and another set of lenses for close vision</p>
<p class="highlight">Hyperopia (farsightedness) – eyeball is too short or cornea is too flat</p>
<p class="answer">Lens focuses behind retina, causing blurry vision when looking at close objects</p>
<p class="answer">Convex lenses correct hyperopia</p>
<p class="highlight">Myopia (nearsightedness) – distance between cornea and lens is too great or cornea is too curved</p>
<p class="answer">Lens is unable to flatten enough and incoming light is focused in front of retina</p>
<p class="answer">Blurring objects viewed at distance</p>
<p class="answer">Concave lenses correct myopia</p>
<p class="highlight">Astigmatism – curvature of lens or cornea is irregular</p>
<p class="answer">Light rays are not evenly refracted</p>
<p class="answer">Results in blurred vision at all distances</p>
<p class="answer">Corrective lenses can adjust for specific abnormal corneal or lens curvatures</p>
<p class="answer">LASIK (laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis): laser is used to remodel cornea and smooth out irregularities</p>
