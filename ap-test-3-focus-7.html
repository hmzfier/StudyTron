<hr class="divider"><p class="question">19. the photoreceptors anatomy and what they detect</p>
<p class="highlight">From Chatgpt</p>
<p class="highlight">Cones</p>
<p class="answer">Short, tapered outer segment</p>
<p class="answer">Less sensitive</p>
<p class="answer">Detect bright light</p>
<p class="answer">Detect color (red, green, blue)</p>
<p class="answer">High detail/visual acuity</p>
<p class="answer">Cones’ contain discs with pigment iodopsin (bolded in red in powerpoint) that absorb different light wavelengths</p>
<p class="highlight">Rods</p>
<p class="answer">Long, cylindrical outer segment</p>
<p class="answer">Highly sensitive</p>
<p class="answer">Detect dim light</p>
<p class="answer">No color; low detail</p>
<p class="highlight">PowerPoint Answer:</p>
<p class="answer">1. Cones – function best in bright light for processing high-resolution color vision</p>
<p class="answer">2. Rods – do not detect colors; most sensitive in low light and as component of peripheral vision</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">23. the anatomy of the ear (outer, middle and inner ear)</p>
<p class="highlight">Outer Ear</p>
<p class="answer">Pinna (auricle)</p>
<p class="answer">External auditory canal - ceruminous glands and secrete cerumen (ear wax)</p>
<p class="answer">Tympanic membrane (eardrum) - Separates outer and middle ear regions</p>
<p class="highlight">Middle Ear</p>
<p class="answer">Pharyngotympanic tube (auditory tube) – connects nasopharynx with middle ear</p>
<p class="answer">Auditory Ossicles: has malleus, incus, stapes. Auditory ossicles form bridge that links tympanic membrane to inner ear</p>
<p class="answer">Oval window</p>
<p class="answer">Round window</p>
<p class="answer">Auditory (Eustachian) tube</p>
<p class="highlight">Inner Ear</p>
<p class="answer">Cochlea (hearing)</p>
<p class="answer">Vestibule (balance)</p>
<p class="answer">Semicircular canals (rotation balance)</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">24. the cochlea chambers and membranes and the spiral organ in the cochlear duct</p>
<p class="highlight">Chambers in cochlea</p>
<p class="answer">• Scala vestibuli – chamber within cochlea</p>
<p class="answer">• Scala tympani – chamber within cochlea</p>
<p class="answer">• Scala media-Cochlear duct (filled with endolymph)</p>
<p class="highlight">Vestibular membrane – sheet of epithelium</p>
<p class="answer">• Separates endolymph from perilymph</p>
<p class="answer">• For maintaining ion homeostasis of each fluid</p>
<p class="highlight">Basilar membrane- collagenous connective tissue</p>
<p class="answer">• Supports spiral organ (organ of Corti) within cochlear duct</p>
<p class="answer">•• Contains receptor cells for hearing</p>
<p class="answer">•• Converts sound wave energy into electrical impulses</p>
<p class="answer">•• Travel to brain by axons in cochlear division of CNVIII</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">26. the structures of the spiral organ and the role they play in hearing</p>
<p class="answer">Where sound wave energy transduced into electrical signals then sent to brain for interpretation</p>
<p class="highlight">Hair cells – receptor cells within spiral organ</p>
<p class="answer">•• Inner hair cells – form single row of cells</p>
<p class="answer">•••primarily responsible for detecting sound</p>
<p class="answer">•• Outer hair cells are in three rows</p>
<p class="answer">• Each hair cell has microvilli called stereocilia that extend into endolymph of cochlear duct</p>
<p class="highlight">Tectorial membrane – stiff structure above hair cells</p>
<p class="answer">•• Sandwiches cells and their stereocilia between tectorial membrane and basilar membrane</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">28. the 2 broad types of hearing loss and what structures are involved with each.</p>
<p class="highlight">Conduction hearing loss – due to problem in outer or middle ear</p>
<p class="answer">• Prevents sound waves from reaching inner ear</p>
<p class="answer">• Causes: excessive buildup of ear wax, middle ear infection, perforated tympanic membrane, or fusion of auditory ossicles</p>
<p class="highlight">Sensorineural hearing loss – deficit in cochlea or any part of neural pathway</p>
<p class="answer">1. Sensory hearing loss – action potentials cannot be generated in cochlea; usually due to hair cell dysfunction</p>
<p class="answer">• Exposure to loud sounds or certain medications may damage hair cells; also lose stereocilia as we age,</p>
<p class="answer">especially those in proximal part of cochlea (responsible for detecting high-frequency sounds)</p>
<p class="answer">• Hearing aids can help mild to moderate cases of sensory hearing loss</p>
<p class="answer">• cochlear implants may also be an option</p>
<p class="answer">2. Neural hearing loss – signals fail to travel through cochlear branch of vestibulocochlear nerve or CNS pathways</p>
<p class="answer">• Typical causes include strokes or tumors</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">29. what vestibular sensation is and the 2 types of equilibrium</p>
<p class="highlight">Vestibular sensation: Sense of equilibrium: Sense of balance, head position, and head movement.</p>
<p class="highlight">Two types of equilibrium:</p>
<p class="answer">Static equilibrium –  maintaining balance when head is tilted but head and body are not moving</p>
<p class="answer">Dynamic equilibrium –  maintaining balance when head or body is undergoing rotational or</p>
<p class="answer">angular motions (such as spinning in rotating chair) or linear acceleration (such as riding in car)</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">30. where the utricle and saccule are located</p>
<p class="answer">Both are in the vestibule of the inner ear.</p>
