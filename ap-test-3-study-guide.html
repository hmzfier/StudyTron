<hr class="divider"><p class="question">11. different ion channels of the neuron plasma membrane</p>
<p class="answer">Leak channels: always open; allow continuous ion flow to maintain resting membrane potential.</p>
<p class="answer">Ligand-gated channels: open when a chemical (neurotransmitter) binds; create local potentials.</p>
<p class="answer">Voltage-gated channels: open/close in response to membrane voltage changes; generate action potentials.</p>
<p class="answer">Mechanically-gated channels: open when the membrane is physically deformed (pressure, stretch).</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">12. what local potentials are and how they are different from action potentials</p>
<p class="highlight">Local potentials</p>
<p class="answer">travel short distances</p>
<p class="answer">Size varies - Local potentials vary in size of membrane potential depending on the stimulus</p>
<p class="answer">Reversible</p>
<p class="highlight">Action potentials</p>
<p class="answer">travel entire length of axon</p>
<p class="answer">Same size - action potentials always depolarize to about +30 mV and their size doesn’t change with stimulus strength, frequency, or duration.</p>
<p class="answer">Irreversible</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">13. the 3 general phases of the Action potential and which channels are open or closed</p>
<p class="highlight">Depolarization: voltage-gated sodium channels open, potassium channels closed.</p>
<p class="answer">membrane potential rises toward zero; then becomes positive briefly Repol</p>
<p class="answer">Makes the membrane becomes more positive</p>
<p class="highlight">Repolarization: sodium channels inactivate, potassium channels open.</p>
<p class="answer">Makes the membrane return toward negative.</p>
<p class="highlight">Hyperpolarization: potassium channels still open briefly, sodium channels reset to closed.</p>
<p class="answer">Makes the membrane MORE negative than resting membrane potential.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">14. Compare and contrast the 2 refractory phases</p>
<p class="answer">Absolute refractory period: no new action potential can occur at all because sodium channels are open or inactivated.</p>
<p class="answer">Relative refractory period :after absolute refractory period; only strong stimulus can produce action potential</p>
<p class="answer">▪ takes much larger stimulus to trigger action potential</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">15. how action potential propagate down the axon and what affects the speed of the action potential</p>
<p class="highlight">Steps</p>
<p class="answer">1. The axolemma depolarizes to threshold due to local potentials</p>
<p class="answer">2. As sodium channels activate, an action potential is triggered and spreads down the axon</p>
<p class="answer">3. the next section of the axolemma depolarizes to threshold and fires an action potential as the previous section of the axolemma repolarizes</p>
<p class="answer">4. the current continues to move down the axon, and the process repeats</p>
<p class="highlight">Above steps simplified by chatgpt</p>
<p class="answer">1. Local potentials bring the first section to threshold.</p>
<p class="answer">2. Na⁺ channels open → the action potential starts and moves forward.</p>
<p class="answer">3. Each new section hits threshold and fires while the previous section repolarizes.</p>
<p class="answer">4. This repeating cycle pushes the action potential down the axon.</p>
<p class="highlight">Steps according to chatgpt</p>
<p class="answer">1. Na⁺ channels open at the trigger zone → an action potential starts.</p>
<p class="answer">2. That depolarization spreads to the next section of the axon.</p>
<p class="answer">3. The next section reaches threshold → Na⁺ channels open there.</p>
<p class="answer">4. The AP regenerates segment by segment down the axon.</p>
<p class="answer">5. Previously active segments enter refractory period, so the AP moves only forward.</p>
<p class="highlight">What increases speed:</p>
<p class="answer">Myelination (fastest; forces AP to jump node-to-node)</p>
<p class="answer">Larger axon diameter (less resistance)</p>
<p class="answer">Higher temperature (up to physiological limits)</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">15.5 Steps of an action potential</p>
<p class="answer">1. A local potential depolarizes the axolemma of the trigger zone to threshold</p>
<p class="answer">2. Voltage gated sodium channels activate, sodium enter, and the axon section depolarizes</p>
<p class="answer">3. Sodium channels inactivate and voltage-gated potassium channels activate, and repolarization begins.</p>
<p class="answer">4. Sodium channels return to the resting state and repolarization continues</p>
<p class="answer">5. the axolemma may hyperpolarize before potassium channels return to the resting state; after this, the axolemma returns to the resting membrane potential</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">15.6 Why does an action potential only move forward?</p>
<p class="answer">An action potential only moves forward because the previous section of the axon is in the refractory period:</p>
<p class="answer">Absolute refractory period: Na⁺ channels are inactivated, so no new AP can fire there.</p>
<p class="answer">This prevents the AP from traveling backward and ensures unidirectional propagation.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">16. Compare and contrast saltatory and continuous conduction</p>
<p class="highlight">Continuous conduction: AP moves along every part of an unmyelinated axon; slower.</p>
<p class="answer">• in unmyelinated axons</p>
<p class="answer">• Every section of axolemma from trigger zone to axon terminal must propagate action potential</p>
<p class="answer">• Slows conduction speed as each successive section of axon must depolarize</p>
<p class="highlight">Saltatory conduction: AP jumps from node to node on a myelinated axon; much faster and more energy-efficient.</p>
<p class="answer">• In myelinated axons where insulating properties of myelin sheath increase efficiency and</p>
<p class="answer">speed of signal conduction</p>
<p class="answer">• Action potentials only depolarize nodes of Ranvier; “jumps” from node to node</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">17. what a synapse is and the 3 places that it can occur</p>
<p class="answer">Synapse: a junction where a neuron communicates with another cell.</p>
<p class="answer">Three locations:</p>
<p class="answer">Axodendritic: axon → dendrite</p>

<p class="answer">Axoaxonic: axon → axon</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">18. Compare and contrast electrical vs. chemical synapses</p>
<p class="highlight">Electrical synapses: direct ion flow through gap junctions; very fast; bidirectional; rare in humans.</p>
<p class="answer">•Axolemmas of each cell in synapse are nearly touching</p>
<p class="answer">• Gap junctions align channels forming pores that ions or other small substances can flow through</p>
<p class="answer">▪ In areas of brain responsible for programmed, automatic behaviors (breathing)</p>
<p class="answer">▪ In cardiac and visceral smooth muscle to allow for coordinated muscle activity</p>
<p class="answer">• Transmission is bidirectional and nearly instantaneous</p>
<p class="highlight">Chemical synapses: use neurotransmitters to signal across a synaptic cleft; slower; unidirectional; most common in humans.</p>
<p class="answer">• Make up majority of synapses in nervous system</p>
<p class="answer">• More efficient than electrical synapses</p>
<p class="answer">• No signal strength is lost (as at electrical synapses)</p>
<p class="answer">• Electrical signal becomes weaker as it dissipates into ECF</p>
<p class="answer">• Convert electrical signals into chemical signals</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">19. the steps of transmission in a chemical synapse</p>
<p class="highlight">Chemical synapse steps:</p>
<p class="answer">1.An action potential in the presynaptic neuron triggers calcium channels in the axon terminal to open</p>
<p class="answer">2. Influx of calcium causes synaptic vesicles to release neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft</p>
<p class="answer">3. neurotransmitters bind to receptors in the postsynaptic neuron</p>
<p class="answer">4. Ion channels open, leading to a local potential and possibly an action potential</p>
<p class="highlight">Chemical synapse steps simplified by chatgpt:</p>
<p class="answer">1. AP arrives → Ca²⁺ channels open.</p>
<p class="answer">2. Calcium triggers neurotransmitter release.</p>
<p class="answer">3. Neurotransmitters bind postsynaptic receptors.</p>
<p class="answer">4. Ion channels open → local potential, possibly triggering an AP.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">20. the postsynaptic potentials (EPSP vs. IPSP)</p>
<p class="highlight">EPSP (excitatory postsynaptic potential): depolarizes the postsynaptic membrane, bringing it closer to threshold.</p>
<p class="answer">Ion channels open and positive charges enter the postsynaptic neuron, causing an EPSP</p>
<p class="highlight">IPSP (inhibitory postsynaptic potential): hyperpolarizes the postsynaptic membrane, moving it further from threshold.</p>
<p class="answer">Ion channels open and the postsynaptic neuron gains negative charges or loses positive charges, causing an IPSP</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">21. neural integration</p>
<p class="answer">the process of combining all excitatory and inhibitory inputs a neuron receives to determine whether it will fire an action potential.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">22. summation</p>
<p class="answer">the addition of multiple postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs and IPSPs) to influence the likelihood of an action potential.</p>
<p class="answer">EPSPs > IPSPs = depolarization</p>
<p class="answer">IPSPs > EPSPs = hyperpolarization</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">23. Compare and contrast temporal vs. spatial summation</p>
<p class="answer">Temporal summation: multiple signals from the same neuron arrive in rapid succession; effects add up over time.</p>
<p class="answer">Spatial summation: signals from multiple neurons arrive at the same time; effects add up across space.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">24. the 3 ways synaptic transmission is terminated</p>
<p class="answer">Reuptake – neurotransmitters are taken back into the presynaptic neuron.</p>
<p class="answer">Enzymatic degradation – enzymes break down neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft.</p>
<p class="answer">Diffusion – neurotransmitters drift away from the synaptic cleft and are returned to the presynaptic neuron</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">25. the 2 types of neurotransmitter receptors</p>
<p class="highlight">Ionotropic receptors: ligand-gated ion channels that open directly when a neurotransmitter binds.</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Directly control movement of ions into or out of neuron when bind to neurotransmitter</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Rapid, short-lived responses</p>
<p class="highlight">Metabotropic receptors: G-protein–coupled receptors that activate signaling pathways inside the cell when a neurotransmitter binds.</p>
<p class="answer">•within plasma membrane and associated with separate ion channel</p>
<p class="answer">• Connected to metabolic processes initiated when neurotransmitter binds to the receptor.</p>
<p class="answer">• G-protein begins activated-results in a cascade of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, then second messenger opens ion channel</p>
<p class="answer">• Slow, long-lived responses</p>
<p class="highlight">Differences between them:</p>
<p class="answer">Ionotropic: fast, direct, opens an ion channel immediately.</p>

<p class="answer">Short Answer: Neuronal circuits are networks of interconnected neurons that transmit and process signals to produce responses. They can be simple, like reflexes, or complex, like those for learning and memory, and involve sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons.</p>
<p class="answer">Long Answer:</p>
<p class="answer">Neuronal circuits are networks of interconnected neurons that work together to process specific types of information and generate responses. Essentially, they are the pathways through which signals travel in the nervous system to perform functions like sensing, thinking, moving, or regulating bodily processes.</p>
<p class="answer">Key points:</p>
<p class="answer">Components: Neurons (sensory, motor, interneurons), synapses, and sometimes supporting glial cells.</p>
<p class="answer">Function: Transmit and integrate electrical and chemical signals.</p>
<p class="answer">Types:</p>
<p class="answer">Simple circuits: Reflex arcs (e.g., knee-jerk reflex).</p>
<p class="answer">Complex circuits: Those in the brain for learning, memory, and higher-order processing.</p>
<p class="answer">Direction of flow: Signals usually move from sensory neurons → interneurons → motor neurons, but some circuits can be recurrent or feedback loops.</p>
<p class="answer">In short, neuronal circuits are the “wiring” of the nervous system that determines how information is processed and how the body responds.</p>

<hr class="divider"><p class="question">25. how sound is processed in the inner ear</p>
<p class="highlight">Chatgpt explanation:</p>
<p class="answer">1. Eardrum → ossicles → oval window vibrates.</p>
<p class="answer">2. Oval window → fluid waves in cochlea → basilar membrane vibrates.</p>
<p class="answer">3. High frequency =  sounds travel only a short distance into the cochlea > basilar membrane vibrates where it is narrow and stiff</p>
<p class="answer">4. Low frequency = travel farther into the cochlea > basilar membrane vibrates where it is wide and flexible</p>
<p class="highlight">Longer explanation:</p>
<p class="answer">1. When sound waves strike the tympanic membrane, movement of the connected auditory ossicles causes the oval window to vibrate at the same frequency.</p>
<p class="answer">2. Vibration of the oval window produces pressure waves in the perilymph of the scala vestibuli and the endolymph of the cochlear duct, which then vibrate the basilar membrane.</p>
<p class="answer">3a. Pressure waves from high-frequency sounds travel only a short distance into the cochlea and cause the basilar membrane to vibrate where it is narrow and stiff.</p>
<p class="answer">3b. Pressure waves from low-frequency sounds travel farther into the cochlea and cause the basilar membrane to vibrate where it is wide and flexible.</p>
