<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Epidermal Ridges</p>
<p class="answer">Definition: downward waves of the epidermis that fit into the dermal papillae</p>
<p class="answer">Location: most prominent in thick skin (palms, soles)</p>
<p class="answer">Function:</p>
<p class="answer">Increase grip/friction</p>
<p class="answer">Strengthen connection between epidermis + dermis</p>
<p class="answer">Form the patterns that create fingerprints !IMPORTANT</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">where and how melanin is produced</p>
<p class="answer">Produced by melanocytes in stratum basale</p>
<p class="answer">Composed of two molecules of amino acid tyrosine; chemically bonded by series of reactions catalyzed by enzyme tyrosinase; occurs in stepwise fashion within special vesicle (melanosome)</p>
<p class="answer">Melanin synthesis increases with exposure to natural or artificial UV radiation; leads to</p>
<p class="answer">tanning (darkening of skin pigmentation); has both immediate and delayed effects on</p>
<p class="answer">skin pigmentation:</p>
<p class="answer">• Immediate response – oxidation of melanin already present in keratinocytes; causes melanin to quickly darken</p>
<p class="answer">• Delayed or secondary effects – UV light causes DNA damage in melanocytes; stimulates melanin production; appears within 72 hours; lasts longer than melanin oxidation</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the functions of melanin</p>
<p class="answer">Primary function – protecting keratinocyte DNA from mutations induced by UV radiation</p>
<p class="answer">Secondary function of melanin: reduces synthesis of vitamin D in response to UV radiation; leads to less calcium ion absorption and maintenance of calcium ion homeostasis within narrow range:</p>
<p class="answer">• Individuals living in regions exposed to high amounts of UV radiation (Africa) developed darker skin to prevent excess vitamin D production</p>
<p class="answer">• People in areas with less UV radiation (northern Europe) developed lighter skin so they could synthesize enough vitamin D</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">how human skin tone can range in a variety of tones</p>
<p class="answer">Amount of melanin produced → more melanin = darker skin</p>
<p class="answer">Spectrum of human skin tones is due to differences in amount of tyrosinase activity and type (color) of melanin produced</p>
<p class="answer">Type of melanin</p>
<p class="answer">Eumelanin = brown/black</p>
<p class="answer">Pheomelanin = red/yellow</p>
<p class="answer">Activity of melanocytes → some people’s melanocytes are more active</p>
<p class="answer">UV exposure → increases melanin production (tanning)</p>
<p class="answer">Genetics → inherited genes control melanin levels and distribution</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the other pigments that affect skin color</p>
<p class="highlight">1. Carotene</p>
<p class="answer">Yellow-orange pigment from diet</p>
<p class="answer">Builds up in stratum corneum + hypodermis</p>
<p class="highlight">2. Hemoglobin</p>
<p class="answer">Red pigment in blood</p>
<p class="answer">More blood flow = pink/red skin</p>
<p class="answer">Less blood flow = pale skin</p>
<p class="highlight">3. Melanin (main pigment, for reference)</p>
<p class="answer">Brown/black or yellow/red types</p>
<p class="answer">Amount + type determine base skin tone</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the basic structure of hair and its functions</p>
<p class="highlight">Functions</p>
<p class="answer">Provides protection by preventing substances and organisms from entering eyes and nose</p>
<p class="answer">Protects underlying skin of scalp from UV radiation and mechanical trauma</p>
<p class="answer">Associated with small sensory neuron; plays role in detecting changes in environment</p>
<p class="highlight">Structure</p>
<p class="answer">Composed of two main parts, both made of stratified squamous keratinized epithelial cells in various stages of development</p>
<p class="highlight">Shaft</p>
<p class="answer">• Portion of hair projecting from skin’s surface</p>
<p class="answer">• Made of columns of dead keratinized epithelial cells that have completed keratinization process</p>
<p class="highlight">Root</p>
<p class="answer">• Segment of hair embedded in dermis; surrounded by small sensory neuron</p>
<p class="answer">• Indented at base by projection of blood vessels from dermis (hair papilla)</p>
<p class="answer">• Root and hair papilla collectively known as hair bulb</p>
<p class="answer">• Many epithelial cells in root are still alive; have not completed keratinization process</p>
<p class="answer">• Root is embedded in hair follicle; infolding of epidermis (epithelial root sheath) extends deep into dermis or even hypodermis</p>
<p class="highlight">Strand of hair has three visible regions in transverse section:</p>
<p class="answer">Inner medulla – soft core only found in thick hair (head); composed of soft keratin</p>
<p class="answer">Middle cortex – highly structured and organized with several layers of keratinocytes containing hard keratin; provides strength</p>
<p class="answer">Outermost cuticle – single layer of overlapping keratinocytes containing hard keratin; provides mechanical strength</p>
<p class="highlight">Dermal root sheath – surrounds epithelial root; consists of connective tissue; supports follicle and keeps it</p>
<p class="answer">separate from dermis</p>
<p class="highlight">Arrector pili muscles – small bands of smooth muscle; attach to dermal root sheath on one end and dermal papillary layer on other</p>
<p class="answer">Contraction of arrector pili causes hair to stand up (piloerection); gives skin dimpled appearance (“goosebumps”)</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the basic structure of nails and its functions</p>
<p class="answer">Nails – hard accessory structures at ends of digits; composed of stratified squamous epithelium filled with hard keratin</p>
<p class="highlight">Structure</p>
<p class="answer">Nail plate - visible hard keratin divided into: Nail Body and Nail Root</p>
<p class="answer">Nail body – visible portion of nail plate</p>
<p class="highlight">Folded regions of skin surround and reinforce nail plate:</p>
<p class="answer">Proximal nail fold – on proximal edge covering nail root; distal edge of fold is eponychium (cuticle); consists of only stratum corneum</p>
<p class="answer">Medial and lateral nail folds – on medial and lateral edges of nail plate respectively</p>
<p class="answer">Distal or free edge of nail plate – attached to underlying nail bed by accumulation of stratum corneum called hyponychium</p>
