<p class="answer">Function: Supports lower back, allows flexion/extension</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the functions of joints</p>
<p class="answer">Enable movement – link between bones allow movement when muscles and</p>
<p class="answer">tendons exert necessary force across joint</p>
<p class="answer">Provide stability – some joints allow limited or no movement; very stable; critical</p>
<p class="answer">for structures such as skull; protect underlying structures</p>
<p class="answer">Allow long bones to lengthen – epiphyseal plate is where long bones</p>
<p class="answer">grow in length during skeletal development; temporary joint</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the functional classification of joints by motion</p>
<p class="answer">1. Synarthroses: Immovable joints (e.g., sutures of the skull)</p>
<p class="answer">2. Amphiarthroses: Slightly movable joints (e.g., intervertebral discs, pubic symphysis)</p>
<p class="answer">3. Diarthroses: Freely movable joints (e.g., shoulder, hip)</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Structural Classification of joints based on Tissue and Structure</p>
<p class="answer">1. Fibrous Joints: Bones joined by dense connective tissue; no joint cavity. NOTE: no joint space</p>
<p class="answer">Examples: sutures, syndesmoses, gomphoses</p>
<p class="answer">2. Cartilaginous Joints: Bones joined by cartilage; no joint cavity or minimal movement. NO JOINT SPACE</p>
<p class="answer">Examples: synchondroses (hyaline cartilage), symphyses (fibrocartilage)</p>
<p class="answer">3. Synovial Joints: Bones separated by a fluid-filled joint cavity; highly movable</p>
<p class="answer">Have layer of hyaline cartilage on articulating surface of each bone;</p>
<p class="answer">Features: articular cartilage, joint cavity, synovial fluid, joint capsule</p>
<p class="answer">Examples: hinge (elbow), ball-and-socket (shoulder, hip), pivot, saddle, condylar, plane</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the 3 fibrous joints: what they are composed of, where to find them and motility classification</p>
<p class="answer">1. Sutures</p>
<p class="answer">immoveable joint between edges of bones;</p>
<p class="answer">make up cranium; fully fused sutures are very stable, well suited for protecting brain</p>
<p class="answer">2. Syndesmoses</p>
<p class="answer">joint between tibia, fibula, ulna, and radius</p>
<p class="answer">bones joined by interosseous membrane or ligament composed of dense regular collagenous connective tissue</p>
<p class="answer">allows for small amount of movement (amphiarthroses)</p>
<p class="answer">3. Gomphoses</p>
<p class="answer">immoveable joint (synarthrosis) between each tooth and bony socket in jaw</p>
<p class="answer">periodontal ligament is strong fibrous membrane; links tooth firmly to jaw bone</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the 2 cartilaginous joints: what they are composed of, where to find them and motility classification</p>
<p class="answer">1. Synchondrosis – bones linked together by hyaline cartilage; synarthroses</p>
<p class="answer">Epiphyseal plates – hyaline cartilage</p>
<p class="answer">▪connects diaphyses and epiphyses of developing long bones; replaced with bone during maturation</p>
<p class="answer">First sternocostal joint and costochondral joints are synchondroses</p>
<p class="answer">▪stabilize rib cage; persist into adulthood</p>
<p class="answer">2. Symphysis – bones united by fibrocartilaginous pad or plug; functionally amphiarthroses</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the structural elements of synovial joints and their function</p>
<p class="answer">1. Joint cavity (synovial cavity) – space between articulating bones</p>
<p class="answer">2. Articular capsule: Has two layers:</p>
<p class="answer">1. Outer fibrous layer – holds the bones together</p>
<p class="answer">2. Inner synovial membrane – lines the inside (except over cartilage) and produces synovial fluid</p>
<p class="answer">3. Synovial fluid – thick liquid with 3 main functions</p>
<p class="answer">Lubrication – reduces friction between articulating surfaces</p>
<p class="answer">Transportation – moves nutrients and waste products in absence of blood vessels within joint</p>
<p class="answer">Shock absorption – helps to evenly distribute stress and force during movement</p>
<p class="answer">4. Articular Cartilage:</p>
<p class="answer">Covers the ends of bones, reduces friction and absorbs shock</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the stabilizing and supporting factors of synovial joints</p>
<p class="highlight">1. Ligaments:</p>
<p class="answer">Connect bone to bone</p>
<p class="answer">Strengthen and stabilize the joint</p>
<p class="highlight">2. Tendons (associated, not part of joint proper):</p>
<p class="answer">Connect muscle to bone</p>
<p class="answer">Assist in joint movement and stability</p>
<p class="highlight">3. Muscle tone – continuous amount muscle contraction = stabilizes</p>
<p class="highlight">4. Bursae (associated structures)</p>
<p class="answer">Fluid-filled sacs between bones, tendons, or muscles</p>
<p class="answer">Reduce friction during movement</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the functional classes of synovial joints</p>
<p class="answer">1. Nonaxial joints – allow motion in 1+ planes without moving around axis</p>
<p class="answer">Examples: Intercarpal joints, intertarsal joints</p>
<p class="answer">2. Uniaxial joints – allow motion around only 1 axis</p>
<p class="answer">Examples:  elbow</p>
<p class="answer">3. Biaxial joints – allow motion around 2 axes</p>
<p class="answer">Examples:  metacarpophalangeal joints - axis 1: flexion/extension, axis 2: move fingers fanned out or in (abduction/adduction)</p>
<p class="answer">4. Multiaxial (triaxial) joints – allow motion around 3 axes</p>
<p class="answer">Examples: shoulder, hip</p>
