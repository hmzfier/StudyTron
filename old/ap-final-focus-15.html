<p class="answer">4. Extensibility - ability to be stretched (up to 3 times resting length) without rupturing</p>
<p class="answer">5. Elasticity - ability to return to original length after stretching</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the structure of the muscle cells</p>
<p class="answer">Myo = prefix meaning muscle</p>
<p class="answer">Myocyte = muscle cell</p>
<p class="answer">Muscle fiber = skeletal muscle cell</p>
<p class="answer">Sarcoplasm = cytoplasm</p>
<p class="answer">Sarcolemma = plasma membrane, but is different from general cell</p>
<p class="answer">It forms inward extensions called transverse tubules (T-tubules) that surround myofibrils</p>
<p class="answer">Sarcoplasmic reticulum = modified smooth ER</p>
<p class="answer">Stores and releases calcium ions. Forms web-like network surrounding myofibrils</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the structure of myofibrils</p>
<p class="answer">Myofibrils are long, cylindrical-like structures inside each muscle fiber (muscle cell).</p>
<p class="answer">100s to 1000s of myofibrils in each myocyte: 50-80% of cell volume</p>
<p class="answer">They are the parts of the muscle that actually contract — they make the muscle shorten and generate force.</p>
<p class="answer">Each muscle fiber contains hundreds to thousands of myofibrils running parallel to each other.</p>
<p class="answer">Myofibrils are made up of repeating units called sarcomeres — the smallest functional units of muscle contraction.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the structure of the three myofilaments and their 3 types of proteins</p>
<p class="answer">Myofilaments → Protein filaments in muscle fibers that make up myofibrils.</p>
<p class="highlight">1. Thick filaments</p>
<p class="answer">Made of myosin</p>
<p class="answer">Structure: Long tail + globular heads that bind actin and ATP.</p>
<p class="highlight">2. Thin filaments</p>
<p class="answer">Made of actin, tropomyosin, and troponin</p>
<p class="answer">Structure: Actin forms a helical chain; tropomyosin blocks myosin-binding sites; troponin binds calcium to move tropomyosin.</p>
<p class="highlight">3. Elastic filaments</p>
<p class="answer">Made of titin</p>
<p class="answer">Structure: Anchors thick filaments to Z-disc; provides elasticity and stabilizes sarcomere.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the structure of the sarcomere and function of the specific regions</p>
<p class="answer">Sarcomere → Functional unit of a muscle fiber, extends from Z-disc to Z-disc.</p>
<p class="highlight">Regions and their functions:</p>
<p class="highlight">Z-disc</p>
<p class="answer">Anchors thin filaments; defines sarcomere boundaries.</p>
<p class="answer">Line bisecting the I band.</p>
<p class="answer">Both the thin and elastic filaments anchor to the z-discs, which also attach myofibrils to one another</p>
<p class="answer">It anchors the actin (thin) filaments, keeping the structure organized during muscle contraction.</p>
<p class="highlight">I-band</p>
<p class="answer">Light regions of striations containing only thin filaments</p>
<p class="answer">each I band has a Z-disc in its middle.</p>
<p class="answer">shortens during contraction.</p>
<p class="highlight">A-band</p>
<p class="answer">The dark band that contains both thick and thin filaments</p>
<p class="answer">This region stays the same length during contraction.</p>
<p class="highlight">H-zone</p>
<p class="answer">Center of A-band. KNOW THAT IT IS IN THE A BAND. HA! acronym</p>
<p class="answer">contains only thick filaments</p>
<p class="answer">shortens during contraction</p>
<p class="highlight">M-line</p>
<p class="answer">Middle of H-zone</p>
<p class="answer">Holds myosin filament in place</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">what membrane potentials are and how to create the resting membrane potential</p>
<p class="answer">The membrane potential is the difference in electrical charge between the inside and outside of a cell’s membrane.</p>
<p class="answer">The inside of a muscle cell is more negative than the outside.</p>
<p class="answer">Resting membrane potential - When the muscle cell is at rest (not contracting), it maintains a steady charge difference called the resting membrane potential.</p>
<p class="highlight">3 ways to create the resting potential:</p>
<p class="answer">1. Concentration gradient = the inside is high in potassium and low in sodium. The outside is high in sodium and low in potassium</p>
<p class="answer">2. Potassium Leak channels - potassium leaks out of the cell = KEEPS INSIDE NEGATIVE = MAINTAINS RESTING POTENTIAL</p>
<p class="answer">3. Sodium-Potassium Pump - Moves 3 sodium out of the cell, 2 potassium into the cell = MAINTAINS RESTING POTENTIAL</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the structure of the neuromuscular junction</p>
<p class="answer">Neuromuscular Junction (NMJ)-  Synapse where a single motor neuron communicates with many muscle fibers</p>
<p class="answer">axon terminal = Small sacs filled with Ach. Release ACh into the synaptic cleft when an action potential arrives</p>
<p class="answer">Synaptic Cleft - Narrow space between axon terminal and muscle fiber. Space ACh diffuses across to reach the muscle</p>
<p class="answer">Motor end plate = Where receptors for ACH are located. Contains ligand-gated sodium channels that open when ACh binds</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the events of the excitation-contraction coupling</p>
<p class="answer">Excitation-contraction coupling → Process linking muscle action potential to contraction.</p>
<p class="answer">Short Answer:</p>
<p class="highlight">Excitation</p>
<p class="answer">1. Action potential reaches axon terminal → calcium ion channels open → calcium enters → ACh released.</p>
<p class="answer">2. ACh binds receptors → Na⁺/K⁺ enter → sarcolemma depolarizes → end-plate potential.</p>
<p class="highlight">Excitation-Contraction Coupling</p>
<p class="answer">3. End-plate potential triggers action potential → travels down T-tubules.</p>
<p class="answer">4. T-tubule depolarization opens SR calcium channels → calcium enters cytosol.</p>
<p class="highlight">Contraction</p>
<p class="answer">5. Calcium binds troponin → tropomyosin moves → actin sites exposed.</p>
<p class="answer">6. Myosin head “cocks” (ATP → ADP + P) → binds actin → power stroke → pulls actin.</p>
<p class="answer">7. ADP released → new ATP detaches myosin → cycle repeats while ATP & calcium are present.</p>
<p class="highlight">Long Answer from book:</p>
<p class="highlight">1. Excitation</p>
<p class="answer">An action potential arrives at the axon terminal and triggers calcium ion channels in the axon terminal to open.</p>
<p class="answer">Calcium ion entry triggers exocytosis of synaptic vesicles.</p>
<p class="answer">Synaptic vesicles release acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft.</p>
<p class="answer">Acetylcholine binds to ligand-gated cation channels in the motor end plate.</p>
<p class="answer">Sodium and potassium channels open and cations enter the muscle fiber.</p>
<p class="answer">Entry of Sodium and potassium depolarizes the sarcolemma locally, producing an end-plate potential.</p>
<p class="highlight">2. Excitation-Contraction Coupling</p>
<p class="answer">The end-plate potential stimulates an action potential.</p>
<p class="answer">The action potential is travels down the T-tubules.</p>
<p class="answer">T-tubule depolarization leads to the opening of calcium ion channels in the terminal cisternae of the  sarcoplasmic reticulum, and calcium ions enter the cytosol.</p>
<p class="highlight">3. Contraction</p>
<p class="answer">Calcium ions bind to troponin.</p>
<p class="answer">Tropomyosin moves, and the active sites of actin are exposed.</p>
<p class="answer">ATP hydrolysis “cocks” the myosin head - ATP hydrolysis turns ATP to ADP and a phosphate group (P)</p>
<p class="answer">The myosin head binds to actin.</p>
<p class="answer">The power stroke occurs when the phosphate detaches from the myosin head</p>
<p class="answer">Then the myosin pulls actin toward the center of the sarcomere</p>
<p class="answer">ADP leaves the myosin head at the end of the power stroke.</p>
<p class="answer">A new ATP breaks the attachment of myosin to actin.</p>
<p class="answer">Then the cross-bridge and power stroke cycle repeats as long as: ATP is available, and Calcium remains present in the sarcoplasm.</p>
