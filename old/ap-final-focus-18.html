<hr class="divider"><p class="question">what a synapse is and the 3 places that it can occur</p>
<p class="answer">Synapse: a junction where a neuron communicates with another cell.</p>
<p class="answer">Three locations:</p>
<p class="answer">Axodendritic: axon → dendrite</p>
<p class="answer">Axosomatic: axon → soma (cell body)</p>
<p class="answer">Axoaxonic: axon → axon</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Compare and contrast electrical vs. chemical synapses</p>
<p class="highlight">Electrical synapses: direct ion flow through gap junctions; very fast; bidirectional; rare in humans.</p>
<p class="answer">•Axolemmas of each cell in synapse are nearly touching</p>
<p class="answer">• Gap junctions align channels forming pores that ions or other small substances can flow through</p>
<p class="answer">▪ In areas of brain responsible for programmed, automatic behaviors (breathing)</p>
<p class="answer">▪ In cardiac and visceral smooth muscle to allow for coordinated muscle activity</p>
<p class="answer">• Transmission is bidirectional and nearly instantaneous</p>
<p class="highlight">Chemical synapses: use neurotransmitters to signal across a synaptic cleft; slower; unidirectional; most common in humans.</p>
<p class="answer">• Make up majority of synapses in nervous system</p>
<p class="answer">• More efficient than electrical synapses</p>
<p class="answer">• No signal strength is lost (as at electrical synapses)</p>
<p class="answer">• Electrical signal becomes weaker as it dissipates into ECF</p>
<p class="answer">• Convert electrical signals into chemical signals</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the steps of chemical synapse</p>
<p class="highlight">Chemical synapse steps:</p>
<p class="answer">1.An action potential in the presynaptic neuron triggers calcium channels in the axon terminal to open</p>
<p class="answer">2. Influx of calcium causes synaptic vesicles to release neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft</p>
<p class="answer">3. neurotransmitters bind to receptors in the postsynaptic neuron</p>
<p class="answer">4. Ion channels open, leading to a local potential and possibly an action potential</p>
<p class="highlight">Chemical synapse steps simplified by chatgpt:</p>
<p class="answer">1. AP arrives → Ca²⁺ channels open.</p>
<p class="answer">2. Calcium triggers neurotransmitter release.</p>
<p class="answer">3. Neurotransmitters bind postsynaptic receptors.</p>
<p class="answer">4. Ion channels open → local potential, possibly triggering an AP.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the functions of central nervous system (CNS)</p>
<p class="answer">1. Sensory functions – detection of sensations inside and outside of body by peripheral nervous system (PNS)</p>
<p class="answer">2. Integrative functions – decision-making processes; exclusive function of Central Nervous system (CNS)</p>
<p class="answer">▪Includes wide variety of functions:</p>
<p class="answer">▪▪Interpretation of sensory information</p>
<p class="answer">▪▪Planning and monitoring movement</p>
<p class="answer">▪▪Maintenance of homeostasis</p>
<p class="answer">▪▪Higher mental functions such as language and learning</p>
<p class="answer">3. Motor functions – stimulation of muscle cell contraction or gland secretion by PNS</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">what the white and gray matter in the brain and spinal cord are made of and where they are located in both organs.</p>
<p class="highlight">Brain:</p>
<p class="answer">Gray matter: made of neuron cell bodies, dendrites, and unmyelinated axons; located in outer cerebrum (cerebral cortex)</p>
<p class="answer">White matter: made of myelinated axons; located beneath the gray matter in the brain (connects different brain regions).</p>
<p class="highlight">Spinal cord:</p>
<p class="answer">Gray matter: located centrally in an H- or butterfly-shaped region; contains neuronal cell bodies and interneurons.</p>
<p class="answer">White matter: located peripherally around the gray matter; contains myelinated axons.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the location and function of the 5 lobes of the cerebrum</p>
<p class="highlight">1.Frontal lobe</p>
<p class="answer">Location: Central sulcus and precentral gyrus</p>
<p class="answer">Function: Responsible for planning and executing movement and complex mental functions such as behavior, conscience, and personality</p>
<p class="highlight">2.Parietal lobe</p>
<p class="answer">Location: top/back of the cerebrum</p>
<p class="answer">Function: Responsible for processing and integrating sensory information and function in attention</p>
<p class="highlight">3.Temporal lobe</p>
<p class="answer">Location: sides of the brain near the temples</p>
<p class="answer">Function: Involved in hearing, language, memory, and emotions</p>
<p class="highlight">4.Occipital lobe</p>
<p class="answer">Location: back of the brain</p>
<p class="answer">Function: Neurons process all information related to vision</p>
<p class="highlight">5.Insula (Insular lobe)</p>
<p class="answer">Location: deep inside the lateral sulcus, under the temporal and frontal lobes</p>
<p class="answer">Function: neurons are currently thought to be involved in functions related to taste and viscera (internal organs)</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the 3 areas of the neocortex and their functions.</p>
<p class="highlight">1.Sensory areas</p>
<p class="answer">Receive and process sensory information</p>
<p class="answer">Examples: primary visual cortex, primary auditory cortex, primary somatosensory cortex</p>
<p class="highlight">2.Motor areas</p>
<p class="answer">Control voluntary movement</p>
<p class="answer">Example: primary motor cortex (initiates movement), premotor cortex (plans movement)</p>
<p class="highlight">3.Association areas</p>
<p class="answer">Integrate information, enable thinking, memory, language, problem-solving</p>
<p class="answer">Make up most of the cortex and connect sensory + motor functions</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the motor areas of the cerebral cortex</p>
<p class="highlight">1.Primary Motor Cortex (precentral gyrus)</p>
<p class="answer">involved in conscious planning (voluntary) of movements.</p>
<p class="highlight">2.Premotor Cortex</p>
<p class="answer">involved in planning, guidance, coordination and execution of movement</p>
<p class="highlight">3. Frontal eye fields</p>
<p class="answer">involved in back and forth eye movements (as in reading)</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the Cerebral cortex’s 2 main somatosensory areas</p>
<p class="answer">1.Primary Somatosensory Cortex (postcentral gyrus)</p>
<p class="answer">interprets incoming somatic sensory stimuli: touch, pressure, pain, temperature, proprioception.</p>
<p class="answer">2.Somatosensory Association Area</p>
<p class="answer">Integrates incoming somatic sensory stimuli  (recognizing objects by touch, understanding shape/texture).</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">where the special senses are located in the cerebral cortex</p>
<p class="answer">• Vision – primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe (calcarine sulcus).</p>
<p class="answer">• Hearing – primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe (superior temporal gyrus).</p>
<p class="answer">• Taste – primary gustatory cortex in the insula and frontal operculum.</p>
<p class="answer">• Smell (olfaction) – primary olfactory cortex in the medial temporal lobe (piriform cortex)</p>
<p class="answer">• Balance (vestibular sense) – vestibular cortex in the insula and parietal lobe.</p>
