<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the effects of the Sympathetic Nervous System on the target cells</p>
<p class="answer">Smooth muscle cells around the pupil: Dilation of the pupil.</p>
<p class="answer">Cells of salivary glands: Increase in secretion in certain cells.</p>
<p class="answer">Cardiac muscle cells: Increase in heart rate and force of contraction.</p>
<p class="answer">Smooth muscle cells of bronchi: Dilation of bronchioles (bronchodilation).</p>
<p class="answer">Cells of sweat glands: Increase in secretion.</p>
<p class="answer">Smooth muscle cells of blood vessels to skin: Constriction of blood vessels (vasoconstriction).</p>
<p class="answer">Smooth muscle cells of blood vessels to skeletal muscles: Dilation of blood vessels (vasodilation).</p>
<p class="answer">Smooth muscle cells of blood vessels to digestive and urinary organs: Vasoconstriction.</p>

<p class="answer">Cells of digestive glands: Decrease in secretion.</p>
<p class="answer">Cells of pancreas and liver: Increase in release of glucose.</p>
<p class="answer">Cells of adrenal medulla: Release of epinephrine and norepinephrine.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the relationship between the Adrenal Medulla and the Sympathetic Nervous System.</p>
<p class="answer">1. it prolongs the duration of the sympathetic nervous system’s effects.</p>
<p class="answer">2. The epinephrine and norepinephrine in the blood can reach cells that are not innervated by sympathetic neurons</p>
<p class="answer">3.The adrenal medulla acts as a “backup” for the sympathetic nervous system—even if the pathways connecting this system with many of its target organs are disrupted, it can still affect these organs indirectly via the adrenal medulla</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the anatomy of the Parasympathetic Nervous System and how it’s organized.</p>
<p class="answer">craniosacral division - cranial and sacral</p>
<p class="highlight">Parasympathetic cranial nerves</p>
<p class="answer">associated with oculomotor (CN III), facial (CN VII), glossopharyngeal (CN IX), and vagus (CN X) nerves</p>
<p class="highlight">Vagus nerves – main parasympathetic nerves that innervate most thoracic and abdominal viscera; 90% of parasympathetic output</p>
<p class="answer">Contribute to cardiac, pulmonary, and esophageal plexuses</p>
<p class="highlight">Parasympathetic sacral nerves</p>
<p class="answer">innervate last segment of large intestine, urinary bladder, and reproductive organs.</p>
<p class="answer">Sacral nerve branches form pelvic splanchnic nerves; then form plexuses in pelvic floor</p>
<p class="highlight">Parasympathetic Neuron Location</p>
<p class="answer">Preganglionic cell bodies: Craniosacral region → brainstem nuclei (CN III, VII, IX, X) + S2–S4 spinal cord</p>
<p class="answer">Postganglionic cell bodies: located in or very near target organs</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the Parasympathetic Neurotransmitters and Receptors</p>
<p class="answer">Both pre- and postganglionic parasympathetic neurons release ACh at their synapses</p>
<p class="highlight">Two Cholinergic Receptors:</p>
<p class="answer">1. Nicotinic receptors – in membranes of all postganglionic neurons</p>
<p class="answer">2. Muscarinic receptors – in membranes of all parasympathetic target cells</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the effects of the Parasympathetic Nervous System on the target cells</p>
<p class="answer">Smooth muscle cells around pupil and lens: constriction of pupil, adjustment of lens for near vision.</p>
<p class="answer">Cells of lacrimal and salivary glands: increase in secretions.</p>
<p class="answer">Cardiac muscle cells: decrease in heart rate.</p>
<p class="answer">Smooth muscle cells of bronchioles: bronchoconstriction.</p>
<p class="answer">Smooth muscle cells of digestive tract and sphincters: contraction of digestive tract smooth muscle, relaxation of sphincters.</p>
<p class="answer">Cells of digestive glands: increase in secretions.</p>
<p class="answer">Smooth muscle cells of urinary sphincters: relaxation of sphincters.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the role of the Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Nervous Systems on maintaining homeostasis</p>
<p class="answer">Sympathetic division is dominant and maintains homeostasis during physically demanding times</p>
<p class="answer">Parasympathetic division maintains homeostasis between periods of increased physical activity</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Be able to compare general and special senses</p>
<p class="answer">General senses = touch, pressure, temperature, pain, and proprioception.</p>
<p class="answer">Special Senses = vision, hearing, taste, smell, and balance (equilibrium).</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">how olfaction receptors are activated.</p>
<p class="answer">Before step 1: Odorants are dissolved in mucus</p>
<p class="answer">1. Odor binds → G-protein activates  →  G -Protein Detaches from receptor</p>
<p class="answer">2. G-protein triggers adenylate cyclase to turn ATP into cAMP.</p>
<p class="answer">3. cAMP opens ion channels → Sodium/Calcium rush in → depolarization → action potential if threshold is hit.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the type of receptors that involved in gustatory sense</p>
<p class="answer">Chemoreceptors</p>
<p class="answer">It’s complicated!! – Involves olfactory chemoreceptors, thermoreceptors, nociceptors, and gustatory chemoreceptors (taste buds= found on tongue and other surfaces of oral cavity)</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the anatomy of the taste bud</p>
<p class="answer">Taste buds – usually located on lateral surfaces of papillae</p>
<p class="highlight">Contain three cell types:</p>
<p class="highlight">1. Gustatory (taste) cells</p>
<p class="answer">▪ specialized epithelial cells with microvilli</p>
<p class="answer">▪ project into opening on papilla surface (taste pore)</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Have receptors that detect different tastes</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Carry taste stimuli to CNS via CN VII, CN IX, CN X</p>
<p class="highlight">2. Basal cells</p>
<p class="answer">stem cells differentiate into new gustatory cells live 10–14 days</p>
<p class="highlight">3. Supporting cells</p>
<p class="answer">▪ physically support gustatory cells</p>
<p class="answer">▪ no role in taste sensation</p>
<p class="highlight">Classified by shape:</p>
<p class="highlight">1. Vallate (circumvallate) papillae – largest, dome-shaped</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Contain 100s of taste buds</p>
<p class="highlight">2. Fungiform papillae – mushroom-shaped</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Contain few taste buds</p>
<p class="highlight">3. Foliate papillae – ridges on sides of tongue</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Only contain taste buds in childhood</p>
<p class="highlight">4. Filiform papillae – long, thin cylinders scattered across tongue</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Devoid of taste buds</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Contain sensory nerve endings to detect food texture and temperature</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the cranial nerves that are associated with gustation</p>
<p class="answer">Cranial nerves for taste: VII (facial), IX (glossopharyngeal), and X (vagus).</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the 5 classes of chemicals that we can taste</p>
<p class="answer">1. Sweet tastes – elicited by simple sugars (glucose, fructose)</p>
<p class="answer">2. Sour tastes – produced by hydrogen ions (citric acid in lemon juice)</p>
<p class="answer">3. Salty tastes – elicited by presence of metal ions (Na+ and K + ions)</p>
<p class="answer">4. Bitter flavors – produced by nitrogen-containing compounds</p>
<p class="answer">▪ commonly in rancid or poisonous substances</p>
<p class="answer">5. Umami – (savory) taste associated with meat or broth</p>
<p class="answer">▪ produced by glutamate or other amino acids</p>
