<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the general processes common to all cells</p>
<p class="answer">• Cell metabolism: sum of all chemical reactions that cell carries out to maintain life (Catabolism, Anabolism, Oxidation/reduction)</p>
<p class="answer">• Transport of substances: substances cell has produced or ingested to variety of destinations</p>
<p class="answer">• Communication: between cell and itself, its surrounding environment, and other cells; chemical and electrical signals</p>
<p class="answer">• Cell reproduction: by cell division (Growth, Reproduction, Replacement of old or damaged tissue)</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the 3 basic components of all animal cells, including their structure and function</p>
<p class="highlight">1. Plasma Membrane</p>
<p class="answer">Structure: Phospholipid bilayer with proteins.</p>
<p class="answer">Function: Controls what enters/exits; protects the cell; helps with communication.</p>
<p class="highlight">2. Cytoplasm</p>
<p class="answer">Structure: Jelly-like fluid (cytosol) + organelles. More structures Below</p>
<p class="answer">Organelles – cellular machines with very specific functions; suspended in cytosol; separate potentially damaging chemical reactions from surrounding cell structures (compartmentalization)</p>
<p class="answer">• Cytoskeleton – network of protein filaments; creates and maintains shape; holds organelles in place; provides transportation for substances within cel</p>
<p class="answer">Function: Site of most cell reactions; holds organelles in place.</p>
<p class="highlight">3. Nucleus</p>
<p class="answer">Structure: Membrane-bound sphere containing DNA.</p>
<p class="answer">Function: Stores genetic information; controls cell activities (“control center”).</p>
<p class="answer">primary location for making most RNA</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Phospholipid bilayer - what is the head and tails hydro-status</p>
<p class="highlight">Phospholipid bilayer</p>
<p class="answer">Double bilayer - effective barrier between ECF and cytosol</p>
<p class="answer">Head = hydrophilic</p>
<p class="answer">Tails = hydrophobic</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Passive Transport</p>
<p class="answer">No energy needed</p>
<p class="answer">Moves from high → low concentration</p>
<p class="answer">• Concentration gradient – force that drives many types of passive transport</p>
<p class="answer">Types to remember:</p>
<p class="answer">• Diffusion – movement from high to low concentration; move down (with) concentration gradient until equilibrium (no net movement) reached</p>
<p class="answer">• Osmosis – Water moves from low to high</p>
<p class="highlight">Water moves across plasma membranes by two methods:</p>
<p class="answer">• Water passes through channel proteins (aquaporins); primary route for osmosis of water</p>
<p class="answer">• Small amounts of water can pass through phospholipid bilayer directly</p>
<p class="answer">NOTE: OSMOSIS IS FROM LOW TO HIGH DESPITE BEING A PASSIVE TRANSPORT. STILL NO ENERGY IS NEEDED</p>
<p class="answer">•  Simple diffusion – moves nonpolar molecules (oxygen, carbon dioxide, lipids, and hydrocarbons); pass through phospholipid bilayer without membrane protein. No protein needed — they slip through the membrane.</p>
<p class="answer">• Facilitated diffusion – moves charged or polar solutes (ions and glucose); cross phospholipid bilayer with help of membrane protein (carrier or channel). Protein needed — uses channels or carriers.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Three variables determine how substance is able to move across plasma membrane by passive or active transport:</p>
<p class="answer">1. Type of substance</p>
<p class="answer">2. Plasma membrane permeability to substance</p>
<p class="answer">3. Concentration of substance in cytosol and ECF</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Dehydration, Sports Drinks, and Water</p>
<p class="answer">• Strenuous exercise results in water and electrolyte loss (sweating); ECF becomes hypertonic; draws water out of cells by osmosis</p>
<p class="answer">•  Sports drinks (mixtures of water, electrolytes, and carbohydrates) are hypotonic; replenish lost water, making ECF mildly hypotonic to cells; water moves back into cells; restore normal cytosol concentration</p>
<p class="answer">•  Plain water rehydrates just as well; care must be taken in severe dehydration; can rehydrate cells too quickly or overhydrate (hypotonic ECF); results in cellular swelling and possibly water poisoning</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Active Transport</p>
<p class="answer">Energy needed – ATP</p>
<p class="answer">Moves from low → high concentration (against gradient)</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the six levels of structural organization</p>
<p class="answer">Chemical (Atoms) > Cells > Tissue > Organ > Organ System > Organism</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Compound contains both metal and nonmetal; bond is</p>
<p class="answer">Ionic</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Molecule contains two or more nonmetals; bond is</p>
<p class="answer">Covalent</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Molecule contains two identical nonmetals</p>
<p class="answer">Nonpolar covalent</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Molecule contains only (or primarily) carbon and hydrogen</p>
<p class="answer">nonpolar covalent</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">If molecule contains two nonmetals of significantly different electronegativities</p>
<p class="answer">polar covalent</p>
<p class="answer">hydrogen and carbon have low electronegativities</p>
<p class="answer">oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus have high electronegativities</p>
