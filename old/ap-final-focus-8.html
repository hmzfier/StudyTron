<p class="highlight">3. Dense Irregular CT</p>
<p class="answer">Location: In high tension areas such as dermis (deep to skin) and surrounding organs and joints</p>
<p class="answer">Function: Strength in many directions</p>
<p class="highlight">4. Adipose Tissue</p>

<p class="answer">Function: Energy storage, insulation, protection</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">SPECIALIZED CONNECTIVE TISSUE</p>
<p class="highlight">1. Cartilage</p>
<p class="answer">Structure: Chondrocytes in lacunae; firm ECM</p>
<p class="answer">Cells: Chondroblasts – immature cells; divide by mitosis and make most of ECM</p>
<p class="answer">Location: Nose, trachea, joints</p>
<p class="answer">Function: Support + cushioning</p>
<p class="answer">Types: Hyaline, elastic, fibrocartilage</p>
<p class="highlight">Hyaline cartilage – most abundant cartilage</p>
<p class="answer">ECM mostly ground substance made of small bundles of fine collagen; gives tissue glossy bluish-gray appearance</p>
<p class="answer">On ends of bones in joints (Articular cartilage), linking sternum to ribs, framing sections of respiratory tract, and in nose</p>
<p class="answer">Most of fetal skeleton is hyaline cartilage; replaced with bone during development</p>
<p class="highlight">Fibrocartilage – filled with bundles of collagen fibers; little room for ground substance in ECM</p>
<p class="answer">Fibroblasts reside in tissue; also chondroblasts and chondrocytes; fill ECM with collagen and some elastic fibers</p>
<p class="answer">Tissue has great tensile strength with some degree of elasticity</p>
<p class="answer">In between bones of fibrous joints; forms articular discs that improve fit of bones in joints</p>
<p class="highlight">Elastic cartilage</p>
<p class="answer">Mostly elastic fibers in ECM</p>
<p class="answer">Allows tissue to vibrate</p>
<p class="answer">In limited number of structures; external ear assists with detection of sound in air; larynx assists with production of sound</p>
<p class="highlight">2. Bone</p>
<p class="answer">Structure: Osteocytes in lacunae; mineralized ECM</p>
<p class="answer">Location: Skeleton</p>
<p class="answer">Function: Support, protection, mineral storage</p>
<p class="highlight">Osteoblasts : “Bone-builders” on outer surface of bones; closely associated with dense irregular</p>
<p class="answer">collagenous connective tissue covering (periosteum)</p>
<p class="highlight">Osteocytes – osteoblasts that have surrounded themselves with ECM in lacunae; mostly</p>
<p class="answer">inactive; continue to make and secrete substances important for bone maintenance</p>
<p class="highlight">Osteoclasts – bone destroyers; carry out process of bone resorption; secrete hydrogen ions</p>

<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the basic structure, functions, locations and types of nervous tissues</p>
<p class="highlight">Structures</p>
<p class="answer">Cell body (soma)</p>
<p class="answer">Axon ; responsible for moving nerve impulse from soma to target cell (another neuron, muscle cell, or gland);</p>
<p class="answer">Dendrites – other extensions protruding from soma; typically short with multiple branches; receive impulses from axons of neighboring neurons; deliver impulses to soma</p>
<p class="highlight">Functions</p>
