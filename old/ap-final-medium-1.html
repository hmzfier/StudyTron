<p class="answer">One axon and one dendrite</p>
<p class="answer">Special sense organs in the PNS, such as the retina and olfactory epithelium</p>
<p class="highlight">Pseudounipolar Neuron</p>
<p class="answer">Sensory (afferent) neurons</p>
<p class="answer">Two axons with no dendrites</p>
<p class="answer">Sensory neurons in the PNS associated with touch, pain, and vibration</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">what local potentials are and how they are different from action potentials</p>
<p class="highlight">Local potentials</p>
<p class="answer">travel short distances</p>
<p class="answer">Size varies - Local potentials vary in size of membrane potential depending on the stimulus</p>
<p class="answer">Reversible</p>
<p class="highlight">Action potentials</p>
<p class="answer">travel entire length of axon</p>
<p class="answer">Same size - action potentials always depolarize to about +30 mV and their size doesn’t change with stimulus strength, frequency, or duration.</p>
<p class="answer">Irreversible</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the 3 general phases of the Action potential and which channels are open or closed</p>
<p class="highlight">Depolarization: voltage-gated sodium channels open, potassium channels closed.</p>
<p class="answer">membrane potential rises toward zero; then becomes positive briefly Repol</p>
<p class="answer">Makes the membrane becomes more positive</p>
<p class="highlight">Repolarization: sodium channels inactivate, potassium channels open.</p>
<p class="answer">Makes the membrane return toward negative.</p>
<p class="highlight">Hyperpolarization: potassium channels still open briefly, sodium channels reset to closed.</p>
<p class="answer">Makes the membrane MORE negative than resting membrane potential.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Compare and contrast the 2 refractory phases</p>
<p class="answer">Absolute refractory period: no new action potential can occur at all because sodium channels are open or inactivated.</p>
<p class="answer">Relative refractory period :after absolute refractory period; only strong stimulus can produce action potential</p>
<p class="answer">▪ takes much larger stimulus to trigger action potential</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Compare and contrast electrical vs. chemical synapses</p>
<p class="highlight">Electrical synapses: direct ion flow through gap junctions; very fast; bidirectional; rare in humans.</p>
<p class="answer">•Axolemmas of each cell in synapse are nearly touching</p>
<p class="answer">• Gap junctions align channels forming pores that ions or other small substances can flow through</p>
<p class="answer">▪ In areas of brain responsible for programmed, automatic behaviors (breathing)</p>
<p class="answer">▪ In cardiac and visceral smooth muscle to allow for coordinated muscle activity</p>
<p class="answer">• Transmission is bidirectional and nearly instantaneous</p>
<p class="highlight">Chemical synapses: use neurotransmitters to signal across a synaptic cleft; slower; unidirectional; most common in humans.</p>
<p class="answer">• Make up majority of synapses in nervous system</p>
<p class="answer">• More efficient than electrical synapses</p>
<p class="answer">• No signal strength is lost (as at electrical synapses)</p>
<p class="answer">• Electrical signal becomes weaker as it dissipates into ECF</p>
<p class="answer">• Convert electrical signals into chemical signals</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">what the white and gray matter in the brain and spinal cord are made of and where they are located in both organs.</p>
<p class="highlight">Brain:</p>
<p class="answer">Gray matter: made of neuron cell bodies, dendrites, and unmyelinated axons; located in outer cerebrum (cerebral cortex)</p>
<p class="answer">White matter: made of myelinated axons; located beneath the gray matter in the brain (connects different brain regions).</p>
<p class="highlight">Spinal cord:</p>
<p class="answer">Gray matter: located centrally in an H- or butterfly-shaped region; contains neuronal cell bodies and interneurons.</p>
<p class="answer">White matter: located peripherally around the gray matter; contains myelinated axons.</p>
