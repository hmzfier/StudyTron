<p class="answer">• Concentration gradient – force that drives many types of passive transport</p>
<p class="answer">Types to remember:</p>
<p class="answer">• Diffusion – movement from high to low concentration; move down (with) concentration gradient until equilibrium (no net movement) reached</p>
<p class="answer">• Osmosis – Water moves from low to high</p>
<p class="highlight">Water moves across plasma membranes by two methods:</p>
<p class="answer">• Water passes through channel proteins (aquaporins); primary route for osmosis of water</p>
<p class="answer">• Small amounts of water can pass through phospholipid bilayer directly</p>
<p class="answer">NOTE: OSMOSIS IS FROM LOW TO HIGH DESPITE BEING A PASSIVE TRANSPORT. STILL NO ENERGY IS NEEDED</p>
<p class="answer">•  Simple diffusion – moves nonpolar molecules (oxygen, carbon dioxide, lipids, and hydrocarbons); pass through phospholipid bilayer without membrane protein. No protein needed — they slip through the membrane.</p>
<p class="answer">• Facilitated diffusion – moves charged or polar solutes (ions and glucose); cross phospholipid bilayer with help of membrane protein (carrier or channel). Protein needed — uses channels or carriers.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Three variables determine how substance is able to move across plasma membrane by passive or active transport:</p>
<p class="answer">1. Type of substance</p>
<p class="answer">2. Plasma membrane permeability to substance</p>
<p class="answer">3. Concentration of substance in cytosol and ECF</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Passive Transport - Tonicity - Isotonic, hypertonic, hypotonic</p>
<p class="answer">Isotonic: Equal solute inside and outside  Water moves equally in both directions  Cell stays the same size</p>
<p class="answer">Hypertonic: ECF – Higher solute outside the cell  Water moves OUT of the cell. Cell shrinks (crenation)</p>
<p class="answer">Hypotonic: ECF –Lower solute outside the cell  Water moves INTO the cell  Cell swells (and can burst = lysis)</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Dehydration, Sports Drinks, and Water</p>
<p class="answer">• Strenuous exercise results in water and electrolyte loss (sweating); ECF becomes hypertonic; draws water out of cells by osmosis</p>
<p class="answer">•  Sports drinks (mixtures of water, electrolytes, and carbohydrates) are hypotonic; replenish lost water, making ECF mildly hypotonic to cells; water moves back into cells; restore normal cytosol concentration</p>
<p class="answer">•  Plain water rehydrates just as well; care must be taken in severe dehydration; can rehydrate cells too quickly or overhydrate (hypotonic ECF); results in cellular swelling and possibly water poisoning</p>

<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the events of the excitation-contraction coupling</p>
<p class="answer">Excitation-contraction coupling → Process linking muscle action potential to contraction.</p>
<p class="answer">Short Answer:</p>
<p class="highlight">Excitation</p>
<p class="answer">1. Action potential reaches axon terminal → calcium ion channels open → calcium enters → ACh released.</p>
<p class="answer">2. ACh binds receptors → Na⁺/K⁺ enter → sarcolemma depolarizes → end-plate potential.</p>
<p class="highlight">Excitation-Contraction Coupling</p>
<p class="answer">3. End-plate potential triggers action potential → travels down T-tubules.</p>
<p class="answer">4. T-tubule depolarization opens SR calcium channels → calcium enters cytosol.</p>
<p class="highlight">Contraction</p>
<p class="answer">5. Calcium binds troponin → tropomyosin moves → actin sites exposed.</p>
<p class="answer">6. Myosin head “cocks” (ATP → ADP + P) → binds actin → power stroke → pulls actin.</p>
<p class="answer">7. ADP released → new ATP detaches myosin → cycle repeats while ATP & calcium are present.</p>
<p class="highlight">Long Answer from book:</p>
<p class="highlight">1. Excitation</p>
<p class="answer">An action potential arrives at the axon terminal and triggers calcium ion channels in the axon terminal to open.</p>
<p class="answer">Calcium ion entry triggers exocytosis of synaptic vesicles.</p>
<p class="answer">Synaptic vesicles release acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft.</p>
<p class="answer">Acetylcholine binds to ligand-gated cation channels in the motor end plate.</p>
<p class="answer">Sodium and potassium channels open and cations enter the muscle fiber.</p>
<p class="answer">Entry of Sodium and potassium depolarizes the sarcolemma locally, producing an end-plate potential.</p>
<p class="highlight">2. Excitation-Contraction Coupling</p>
<p class="answer">The end-plate potential stimulates an action potential.</p>
<p class="answer">The action potential is travels down the T-tubules.</p>
<p class="answer">T-tubule depolarization leads to the opening of calcium ion channels in the terminal cisternae of the  sarcoplasmic reticulum, and calcium ions enter the cytosol.</p>
<p class="highlight">3. Contraction</p>
<p class="answer">Calcium ions bind to troponin.</p>
<p class="answer">Tropomyosin moves, and the active sites of actin are exposed.</p>
<p class="answer">ATP hydrolysis “cocks” the myosin head - ATP hydrolysis turns ATP to ADP and a phosphate group (P)</p>
<p class="answer">The myosin head binds to actin.</p>
<p class="answer">The power stroke occurs when the phosphate detaches from the myosin head</p>
<p class="answer">Then the myosin pulls actin toward the center of the sarcomere</p>
<p class="answer">ADP leaves the myosin head at the end of the power stroke.</p>
<p class="answer">A new ATP breaks the attachment of myosin to actin.</p>
<p class="answer">Then the cross-bridge and power stroke cycle repeats as long as: ATP is available, and Calcium remains present in the sarcoplasm.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the role of calcium in a muscle contraction and where it comes from</p>
<p class="answer">Without calcium, no contraction can happen — actin and myosin can’t interact.</p>
<p class="answer">Source of calcium → Released from sarcoplasmic reticulum into the muscle cytosol.</p>
<p class="answer">Role in contraction → Binds troponin, moves tropomyosin off actin binding sites → allows myosin to bind actin → enables cross-bridge cycling and muscle contraction.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the cross-bridge cycle components: how ATP is involved, what the power stroke is</p>
<p class="answer">Cross-bridge cycle components in order:</p>
<p class="answer">1. ATP binds myosin → detaches myosin from actin.</p>
<p class="answer">2. ATP hydrolysis (ATP → ADP + P) → “cocks” myosin head into high-energy position.</p>
<p class="answer">3. Myosin binds actin → forms cross-bridge.</p>
<p class="answer">4. Power stroke → phosphate release causes myosin head to pivot, pulling actin toward sarcomere center.</p>
<p class="answer">5. ADP released → myosin remains bound until new ATP attaches → cycle repeats.</p>

<p class="highlight">Relay station</p>
<p class="answer">The spinal cord acts as a relay station and an intermediate point between the body and the brain; in fact, it’s the only means by which the brain can communicate with most of the body below the head and neck. It receives outgoing stimuli from the brain and sends them to the rest of the body; it also receives incoming stimuli from the body and sends them to the brain.</p>
<p class="highlight">Processing station</p>
