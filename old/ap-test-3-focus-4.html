<p class="title">Test 3 Focus 4</p>

<hr class="divider"><p class="question">21. the 3 meningeal layers and 3 spaces that help protect the brain</p>
<p class="highlight">Meningeal layers: dura mater, arachnoid mater, pia mater.</p>
<p class="answer">dura mater- thickest and most durable meningeal layer. double-layered membrane (periosteal and meningeal dura)</p>
<p class="answer">arachnoid mater- thin weblike membrane</p>
<p class="answer">pia mater-– deepest meningeal layer. Has physical contact with brain tissue. Permeable to substances in brain extracellular fluid and CSF. Allows for substances to move between fluid compartments</p>
<p class="highlight">Spaces: epidural, subdural, subarachnoid.</p>
<p class="answer">epidural space-”Potentially” between skull and dura mater. Only allows passage of blood vessels</p>
<p class="answer">subdural space- serous fluid-filled space. houses veins that drain blood from brain</p>
<p class="answer">subarachnoid space –contains major blood vessels of brain. filled with CSF</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">23. how Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is produced</p>
<p class="answer">Produced mostly in choroid plexuses (and in ependymal cells), where blood plasma is filtered and modified into CSF.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">25. the 2 primary roles of the spinal cord</p>
<p class="highlight">Relay station</p>
<p class="answer">The spinal cord acts as a relay station and an intermediate point between the body and the brain; in fact, it’s the only means by which the brain can communicate with most of the body below the head and neck. It receives outgoing stimuli from the brain and sends them to the rest of the body; it also receives incoming stimuli from the body and sends them to the brain.</p>
<p class="highlight">Processing station</p>
<p class="answer">Although the spinal cord cannot perform the higher functions characteristic of the brain, it does do some integration and processing. Indeed, certain activities called spinal reflexes can be carried out by the spinal cord alone, without influence from the brain</p>
<p class="highlight">From chatgpt</p>
<p class="answer">Send signals between brain and body.</p>
<p class="answer">Coordinate reflexes.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">27. the external anatomy of the spinal cord</p>
<p class="answer">Cervical and lumbar enlargements – widened areas for limb nerves.</p>
<p class="answer">Conus medullaris – tapered end of the spinal cord.</p>
<p class="answer">Cauda equina – bundle of spinal nerves below the conus.</p>
<p class="answer">Filum terminale – thin strand anchoring the cord.</p>
<p class="answer">Anterior median fissure and posterior median sulcus – grooves dividing the cord.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">29. the spinal cord white matter: know what is the difference between ascending and descending tracts, location of 1st, 2nd and 3rd order neurons. (details of each tract are not required)</p>
<p class="answer">White matter tracts:</p>
<p class="answer">• Ascending tracts – carry sensory information to the brain.</p>
<p class="answer">1st-order neurons – PNS</p>
<p class="answer">2nd-order neurons – located in posterior horn of spinal cord or in the brainstem</p>
<p class="answer">3rd-order neurons – thalamus</p>
<p class="answer">• Descending tracts – carry motor commands from the brain to the body.</p>
<p class="answer">Upper motor neurons – from cerebral cortex/brainstem to spinal cord.</p>
<p class="answer">Lower motor neurons – from spinal cord to muscles.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">30. Understand how body parts are represented on primary somatosensory cortex (somatotopy) and the primary motor cortex; (body part representations on the cortex not required)</p>
<p class="answer">The primary somatosensory cortex maps the body’s sensory input</p>
<p class="answer">The primary motor cortex maps motor control.</p>
<p class="answer">This mapping is called somatotopy, where different body parts have specific cortical regions.</p>
<p class="answer">Each part of body is represented by specific region of S1; type of organization called somatotopy</p>
<p class="answer">This is the homunculus we learned in class. A disproportionate amount of space is dedicated to the hands and the face</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">31. how CNS plans and coordinates voluntary movement including the role of the cerebral cortex, basal nuclei and cerebellum</p>
<p class="answer">• Cerebral cortex – plans and initiates voluntary movement.</p>
<p class="answer">• Basal nuclei – help start, stop, and smooth movements; inhibit unnecessary movements.</p>
<p class="answer">• Cerebellum – coordinates timing, precision, and balance of movements.</p>
<p class="highlight">Steps</p>
<p class="answer">1. CNS: Upper motor neurons in the premotor cortex select a motor program and stimulate the basal nuclei</p>
<p class="answer">2. The basal nuclei remove inhibition from the thalamus which stimulates upper motor neurons of the primary motor cortex</p>
<p class="answer">3. CNS to PNS: upper motor neurons stimulate lower motor neurons</p>
<p class="answer">4. PNS: Lower motor neurons stimulate a muscle to contract</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">the 2 divisions (Sensory and motor) divisions</p>
<p class="highlight">Sensory = Somatic Sensory and Visceral Sensory</p>
<p class="answer">Somatic sensory division – detects both internal and external stimuli</p>
<p class="answer">▪ General sense receptors detect stimuli from skin and skeletal muscles</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Special sensory receptors detect stimuli from special sense organs</p>
<p class="highlight">Motor = Somatic motor and Visceral Motor</p>
<p class="answer">Somatic motor division – voluntary motor functions</p>
<p class="answer">– Lower motor neurons (somatic motor neurons) that directly trigger skeletal muscle contractions</p>
<p class="answer">Visceral motor division (autonomic motor nervous system, ANS) – maintains homeostasis by controlling involuntary motor functions in body</p>
<p class="answer">▪ cardiac muscle cells, smooth muscle cells, and secretory cells of glands</p>
<p class="highlight">ANS is further divided into:</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight division) – homeostasis activities surrounding physical work and visceral responses of emotions</p>
<p class="answer">▪ Parasympathetic system (rest and digest division) –digestion and maintaining body’s homeostasis at rest</p>
<p class="answer">Visceral sensory division – relays internal info (like blood pressure) from organs of abdominopelvic and thoracic cavities</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Name some general senses and special senses from the somatic sensory division.</p>
<p class="answer">General senses: touch, pressure, vibration, pain, temperature, proprioception.</p>
<p class="answer">Special senses: vision, hearing, equilibrium (balance), taste, smell.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">3. the structures of the spinal nerves</p>
<p class="answer">Endoneurium =  connective tissue around each axon</p>
<p class="answer">Perineurium = around each fascicle</p>
<p class="answer">Epineurium = connective tissue around the entire nerve. Holds motor and sensory axons together</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">5. Know each cranial nerve’s Roman numeral, location, and function</p>
<p class="answer">I. Olfactory – nasal cavity to cerebrum; smell</p>

<p class="answer">V. Trigeminal – pons; facial sensation, chewing</p>
<p class="answer">VI. Abducens – pons; eye movement (lateral rectus)</p>
<p class="answer">VII. Facial – pons; facial expression, taste (anterior 2/3 tongue), glands</p>
<p class="answer">VIII. Vestibulocochlear – pons/medulla; hearing and balance</p>
<p class="answer">IX. Glossopharyngeal – medulla; taste (posterior 1/3), swallowing</p>
<p class="answer">X. Vagus – medulla; parasympathetic to organs, swallowing, voice</p>
<p class="answer">XI. Accessory – medulla/spinal cord; sternocleidomastoid & trapezius</p>
<p class="answer">XII. Hypoglossal – medulla; tongue movement</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">6. Describe a nerve plexus</p>
<p class="answer">a network of mixed spinal nerve branches that join and form new nerves for a body region.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">7. the 4 spinal nerve plexuses and the specific nerves (like Phrenic) that we discussed in class</p>
<p class="answer">Cervical plexus: phrenic nerve. Nerve roots: C3 and C5 (3-4-5 to stay alive); innervates diaphragm</p>
