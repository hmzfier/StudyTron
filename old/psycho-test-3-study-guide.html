<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Why are alcohol, opioids and sedative hypnotics considered depressants?</p>
<p class="answer">Because they slow down CNS activity by enhancing inhibitory neurotransmission (mainly GABA) or reducing excitatory signaling, which decreases brain and body function.</p>

<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Why do scientists believe that women get drunk on average quicker than men?</p>
<p class="answer">Lower alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH</p>
<p class="answer">Women have lower alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity in the stomach, so they break down less alcohol before it enters the bloodstream.</p>
<p class="answer">More unmetabolized alcohol reaches the blood → higher BAC → they get drunk faster.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Where is alcohol metabolized (what organ)? What is the average rate that alcohol is broken down per</p>

<p class="answer">d. Can withdrawal from sedative hypnotics be life threatening?</p>
<p class="answer">Yes, especially if you are addicted to alcohol or sedatives hypnotics (like valium, xanax)</p>
<p class="answer">e. Why is tolerance to barbiturates especially dangerous?</p>
<p class="answer">Because tolerance to barbiturates develops quickly for the “high” but not for the lethal respiratory-depressant effects.</p>
<p class="answer">That means the dose needed to feel effects goes up, but the dose that can stop breathing does not, making overdose very easy and very dangerous.</p>
<p class="answer">Basically, you can stop breathing</p>

<p class="answer">Many of today’s therapists use avatars to help clients overcome their psychological problems. In this form of virtual reality therapy, clinicians have the clients interact with computer-generated on-screen virtual human figures.</p>
<p class="answer">For a pilot study, the researchers selected 16 participants who were being tormented by imaginary voices (auditory hallucinations). In each case, the therapist presented the individual with a mean-sounding and mean-looking avatar that appeared on-screen. The avatar’s voice pitch and appearance were designed based on the patient’s description of the auditory hallucination and what the patient believed would be a corresponding face</p>
<p class="answer">The patient was placed alone in a room with the computer simulation while the therapist generated the on-screen avatar from another room. Initially, the avatar spewed all sorts of frightening and upsetting statements at the patient. Then the therapist encouraged the patient to fight back — to tell the avatar things such as “I will not put up with this,” “What you are saying is nonsense,” “I don’t believe these things,” “You must go away and leave me alone,” and “I do not need this kind of torment.”</p>
<p class="answer">After seven 30-minute sessions, most of the participants in the pilot study had less frequent and less intense auditory hallucinations and reported being less upset by the voices that they did continue to hear. The participants also reported improvements in their feelings of depression and suicidal thinking.</p>
<p class="answer">The collective results of these studies suggest that confronting one’s hallucinations in a virtual world can indeed help at least some people with schizophrenia.</p>

<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are some of the criticism of the current DSM with regard to personality disorders?</p>
<p class="answer">A key criticism of DSM-5-TR is that it classifies personality disorders categorically instead of dimensionally.</p>
<p class="answer">Many theorists argue personality disorders vary more in severity than in type, so classification should focus on how extreme key personality traits are rather than whether specific traits are simply present or absent.</p>
<p class="answer">a. How might the Big 5 be used to classify personality?</p>
<p class="answer">It can be used to classify personality by measuring where a person falls on each dimension (high, low), rather than assigning them to a fixed category. This allows for a dimensional approach, showing the degree of traits rather than labeling someone with a disorder.</p>
<p class="answer">b. Know what the Big 5 are.</p>
<p class="answer">neuroticism, extroversion, openness to experiences, agreeableness, and conscientiousness</p>
<p class="answer">c. Be familiar with the “personality disorder trait specified” approach</p>
<p class="answer">Instead of using fixed categories, this approach describes personality disorders based on the specific maladaptive traits a person shows.</p>
