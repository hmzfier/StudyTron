<hr class="divider"><p class="subTopicHeader">Chapter 5: Disorders of Trauma and Stress</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">How are the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems different?</p>
<p class="answer">The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) prepares the body for "fight or flight" by increasing heart rate, dilating pupils, and releasing adrenaline</p>
<p class="answer">The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) promotes "rest and digest," slowing heart rate and supporting digestion.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">During a stressful situation, what systems are activated? What about a calm situation?</p>
<p class="answer">During stressful situations, the sympathetic nervous system and the HPA axis are activated.</p>
<p class="answer">During calm situations, the parasympathetic nervous system predominates.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are the 2 pathways associated with fear?</p>
<p class="answer">Fast pathway: Thalamus → Amygdala (immediate reaction)</p>
<p class="answer">Slow pathway: Thalamus → Cortex → Amygdala (more processed, thoughtful response)</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is the HPA pathway?</p>
<p class="answer">The HPA pathway involves: Hypothalamus → Pituitary → Adrenal glands, resulting in cortisol release during stress.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are the symptoms of PTSD? Criteria for PTSD and Acute Stress Disorder How does it differ from acute stress disorder?</p>
<p class="answer">PTSD symptoms: Re-experiencing trauma, avoidance, negative mood/cognition, hyperarousal.</p>
<p class="answer">PTSD Criteria</p>
<p class="answer">A. Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence through direct experience, witnessing, learning about it in close others, or repeated extreme exposure.</p>

<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What treatments have received empirical support in the treatment of trauma related disorders?</p>
<p class="answer">Trauma-focused CBT, prolonged exposure, cognitive processing therapy, EMDR.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is EMDR? Why does it seem to be effective?</p>
<p class="answer">EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing): Uses guided eye movements while recalling trauma</p>
<p class="answer">effective likely because it helps reprocess traumatic memories.</p>
<p class="answer">Longer answer:</p>
<p class="answer">Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) – A psychotherapy technique used primarily to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). During EMDR, the patient recalls traumatic memories while simultaneously focusing on an external bilateral stimulus—usually side-to-side eye movements, tones, or taps guided by the therapist.</p>
<p class="answer">It is effective for PTSD because:</p>
<p class="answer">It helps the brain reprocess traumatic memories, moving them from a highly emotional, “stuck” state into more adaptive, normal memory networks.</p>
<p class="answer">The dual attention (thinking about the trauma while focusing on external movement) seems to reduce the emotional intensity of the memory.</p>
<p class="answer">It allows traumatic memories to be integrated with more balanced thoughts and feelings, lessening distress, avoidance, and flashbacks.</p>
<p class="answer">Neurobiologically, it may help the brain mimic the natural processing seen in REM sleep, which aids emotional healing and memory consolidation.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">Describe psychological debriefing. How effective is this type of intervention? Is it recommended for most people who have been in traumatic situations?</p>
<p class="answer">Immediate post-trauma counseling</p>
<p class="answer">evidence shows little long-term benefit and may be harmful; not recommended universally.</p>
<p class="answer">Long Answer:</p>
<p class="answer">Psychological debriefing – A structured, single-session intervention usually conducted within a few days after a traumatic event (e.g., disasters, accidents, violence). Participants are encouraged to talk about their emotions, reactions, and experiences in a group or individual setting, with the goal of preventing later psychological problems like PTSD.</p>
<p class="answer">Effectiveness:</p>
<p class="answer">Research has shown that psychological debriefing does not reliably prevent PTSD or long-term distress. In some cases, it may even worsen symptoms, possibly because it pushes people to relive traumatic experiences before they’re ready or interferes with their natural coping processes.</p>

<p class="answer">Localized: Specific time period forgotten</p>
<p class="answer">Selective: Only some events forgotten</p>
<p class="answer">Generalized: Whole life forgotten</p>
<p class="answer">Continuous:  a person loses memory starting from a certain point in time (the triggering event) and cannot remember anything that happens after that, including new experiences up to the present.</p>

<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What are tricyclics? Second generation antidepressants? Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors?</p>
<p class="answer">Tricyclics (TCAs) – An older class of antidepressants that increase levels of norepinephrine and serotonin in the brain by blocking their reuptake into neurons. Examples include amitriptyline, imipramine, and nortriptyline. They can be effective but often cause more side effects (dry mouth, constipation, weight gain, drowsiness, cardiac issues).</p>
<p class="answer">Second-generation antidepressants – Newer drugs developed after TCAs and MAO inhibitors, designed to be as effective but with fewer side effects. This group includes SSRIs, SNRIs (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), and atypical antidepressants like bupropion (Wellbutrin) and mirtazapine (Remeron).</p>
<p class="answer">Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) – The most commonly prescribed antidepressants today. They selectively block the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT) in the brain, increasing its availability in synapses. Examples: fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa), and escitalopram (Lexapro).</p>

<p class="answer">All these are neuromodulation for treatment-resistant depression.</p>
<p class="answer">Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) – A device is surgically implanted under the skin of the chest and connected to the vagus nerve in the neck. It sends mild electrical impulses to the nerve, which then carries signals to the brain. Used mainly to treat epilepsy and depression that don’t respond to medication.</p>
<p class="answer">Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) – A noninvasive procedure where an electromagnetic coil placed on the scalp generates magnetic fields that stimulate nerve cells in specific brain regions (often the prefrontal cortex). Commonly used to treat major depression and sometimes anxiety or OCD.</p>
<p class="answer">Deep brain stimulation (DBS) – A neurosurgical procedure where electrodes are implanted deep in specific brain areas (like the basal ganglia or thalamus). These electrodes deliver continuous electrical impulses from a battery-powered device in the chest. Used to treat Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor, dystonia, and severe cases of OCD or depression.</p>

<p class="answer">Hormone explanation: Hormonal fluctuations (e.g., menstrual cycle, pregnancy, postpartum, menopause) may increase women’s vulnerability to depression.</p>
<p class="answer">Life stress theory: Women often face more chronic stressors, such as poverty, discrimination, caregiving burdens, or relationship challenges, contributing to depression risk.</p>
<p class="answer">Body dissatisfaction theory: Cultural pressures for women to achieve unrealistic beauty standards lead to chronic dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, and depressive symptoms.</p>
<p class="answer">Lack-of-control theory: Women may experience a sense of powerlessness in certain social roles or situations, fostering feelings of helplessness and depression.</p>
<p class="answer">Rumination theory: Women are more likely than men to focus repetitively on negative emotions and problems, which intensifies and prolongs depressive episodes.</p>
<hr class="divider"><p class="question">What is the treatment of choice for mild to moderate levels of depression (as discussed in class)?</p>
<p class="answer">Psychotherapy, especially CBT or IPT.</p>
